Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

This is the Django 0.91 "bugfixes" branch, which is inetnded to provide
bugfix and patch support for users of Django version 0.91, which was
the last version before a series of major API changes. No new features
will be added in this branch, and it is maintained solely as a means
of providing support to legacy Django installations. If you're just
starting out with Django, we highly recommend that you use the latest
stable release or a Subversion checkout from Django's trunk.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/0_91/.  If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you read the docs:

    * First, read docs/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.

    * Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/tutorial01.txt,
      docs/tutorial02.txt, etc.).

    * If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read docs/modpython.txt
      for instructions on running Django under mod_python.

    * The rest of the documentation is of the reference-manual variety.
      Read it -- and the FAQ -- as you run into problems.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they
should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket
here:
