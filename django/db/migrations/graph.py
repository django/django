    this is to support the "squash" feature. The graph handler isn't

    examine the migration files and if the replaced migrations are all either
    unapplied or not present, it should ignore the replaced ones, load in just
    the replacing migration, and repoint any dependencies that pointed to the
    replaced migrations to point to the replacing one.
