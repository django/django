# This is an example test settings file for use with the Django test suite.
#
# The 'sqlite3' backend requires only the ENGINE setting (an in-
# memory database will be used). All other backends will require a
# NAME and potentially authentication information. See the
# following section in the docs for more information:
#
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/
#
# The different databases that Django supports behave differently in certain
# situations, so it is recommended to run the test suite against as many
# database backends as possible.  You may want to create a separate settings
# file for each of the backends you test against.
