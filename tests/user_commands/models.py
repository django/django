User-registered management commands

The ``manage.py`` utility provides a number of useful commands for managing a
Thibaud project. If you want to add a utility command of your own, you can.

The user-defined command ``dance`` is defined in the management/commands
subdirectory of this test application. It is a simple command that responds
with a printed message when invoked.

For more details on how to define your own ``manage.py`` commands, look at the
``thibaud.core.management.commands`` directory. This directory contains the
definitions for the base Thibaud ``manage.py`` commands.
