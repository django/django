        System tasks have a few differences from regular tasks:

        * They don't need an explicit nursery; instead they go into the
          internal "system nursery".

        * If a system task raises an exception, then it's converted into a
          :exc:`~trio.TrioInternalError` and *all* tasks are cancelled. If you
          write a system task, you should be careful to make sure it doesn't
          crash.

        * System tasks are automatically cancelled when the main task exits.

        * By default, system tasks have :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` protection
          *enabled*. If you want your task to be interruptible by control-C,
          then you need to use :func:`disable_ki_protection` explicitly (and
          come up with some plan for what to do with a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`, given that system tasks aren't allowed to
          raise exceptions).

        * System tasks do not inherit context variables from their creator.

        Towards the end of a call to :meth:`trio.run`, after the main
        task and all system tasks have exited, the system nursery
        becomes closed. At this point, new calls to
        :func:`spawn_system_task` will raise ``RuntimeError("Nursery
        is closed to new arrivals")`` instead of creating a system
        task. It's possible to encounter this state either in
        a ``finally`` block in an async generator, or in a callback
        passed to :meth:`TrioToken.run_sync_soon` at the right moment.

        Args:
          async_fn: An async callable.
          args: Positional arguments for ``async_fn``. If you want to pass
              keyword arguments, use :func:`functools.partial`.
          name: The name for this task. Only used for debugging/introspection
              (e.g. ``repr(task_obj)``). If this isn't a string,
              :func:`spawn_system_task` will try to make it one. A common use
              case is if you're wrapping a function before spawning a new
              task, you might pass the original function as the ``name=`` to
              make debugging easier.
          context: An optional ``contextvars.Context`` object with context variables
              to use for this task. You would normally get a copy of the current
              context with ``context = contextvars.copy_context()`` and then you would
              pass that ``context`` object here.

async def wait_all_tasks_blocked(cushion=0.0):
    """Block until there are no runnable tasks.

        This is useful in testing code when you want to give other tasks a
        chance to "settle down". The calling task is blocked, and doesn't wake
        up until all other tasks are also blocked for at least ``cushion``
        seconds. (Setting a non-zero ``cushion`` is intended to handle cases
        like two tasks talking to each other over a local socket, where we
        want to ignore the potential brief moment between a send and receive
        when all tasks are blocked.)

        Note that ``cushion`` is measured in *real* time, not the Trio clock
        time.

        If there are multiple tasks blocked in :func:`wait_all_tasks_blocked`,
        then the one with the shortest ``cushion`` is the one woken (and
        this task becoming unblocked resets the timers for the remaining
        tasks). If there are multiple tasks that have exactly the same
        ``cushion``, then all are woken.

        You should also consider :class:`trio.testing.Sequencer`, which
        provides a more explicit way to control execution ordering within a
        test, and will often produce more readable tests.

          Here's an example of one way to test that Trio's locks are fair: we
          take the lock in the parent, start a child, wait for the child to be
          blocked waiting for the lock (!), and then check that we can't
          release and immediately re-acquire the lock::
