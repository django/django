# General theory of operation:
#
# We implement an API that closely mirrors the stdlib ssl module's blocking
# API, and we do it using the stdlib ssl module's non-blocking in-memory API.
# The stdlib non-blocking in-memory API is barely documented, and acts as a
# thin wrapper around openssl, whose documentation also leaves something to be
# desired. So here's the main things you need to know to understand the code
# in this file:
#
# We use an ssl.SSLObject, which exposes the four main I/O operations:
#
# - do_handshake: performs the initial handshake. Must be called once at the
#   beginning of each connection; is a no-op once it's completed once.
#
# - write: takes some unencrypted data and attempts to send it to the remote
#   peer.

# - read: attempts to decrypt and return some data from the remote peer.
#
# - unwrap: this is weirdly named; maybe it helps to realize that the thing it
#   wraps is called SSL_shutdown. It sends a cryptographically signed message
#   saying "I'm closing this connection now", and then waits to receive the
#   same from the remote peer (unless we already received one, in which case
#   it returns immediately).
#
# All of these operations read and write from some in-memory buffers called
# "BIOs", which are an opaque OpenSSL-specific object that's basically
# semantically equivalent to a Python bytearray. When they want to send some
# bytes to the remote peer, they append them to the outgoing BIO, and when
# they want to receive some bytes from the remote peer, they try to pull them
# out of the incoming BIO. "Sending" always succeeds, because the outgoing BIO
# can always be extended to hold more data. "Receiving" acts sort of like a
# non-blocking socket: it might manage to get some data immediately, or it
# might fail and need to be tried again later. We can also directly add or
# remove data from the BIOs whenever we want.
#
# Now the problem is that while these I/O operations are opaque atomic
# operations from the point of view of us calling them, under the hood they
# might require some arbitrary sequence of sends and receives from the remote
# peer. This is particularly true for do_handshake, which generally requires a
# few round trips, but it's also true for write and read, due to an evil thing
# called "renegotiation".
#
# Renegotiation is the process by which one of the peers might arbitrarily
# decide to redo the handshake at any time. Did I mention it's evil? It's
# pretty evil, and almost universally hated. The HTTP/2 spec forbids the use
# of TLS renegotiation for HTTP/2 connections. TLS 1.3 removes it from the
# protocol entirely. It's impossible to trigger a renegotiation if using
# Python's ssl module. OpenSSL's renegotiation support is pretty buggy [1].
# Nonetheless, it does get used in real life, mostly in two cases:
#
# 1) Normally in TLS 1.2 and below, when the client side of a connection wants
# to present a certificate to prove their identity, that certificate gets sent
# in plaintext. This is bad, because it means that anyone eavesdropping can
# see who's connecting – it's like sending your username in plain text. Not as
# bad as sending your password in plain text, but still, pretty bad. However,
# renegotiations *are* encrypted. So as a workaround, it's not uncommon for
# systems that want to use client certificates to first do an anonymous
# handshake, and then to turn around and do a second handshake (=
# renegotiation) and this time ask for a client cert. Or sometimes this is
# done on a case-by-case basis, e.g. a web server might accept a connection,
# read the request, and then once it sees the page you're asking for it might
# stop and ask you for a certificate.
#
# 2) In principle the same TLS connection can be used for an arbitrarily long
# time, and might transmit arbitrarily large amounts of data. But this creates
# a cryptographic problem: an attacker who has access to arbitrarily large
# amounts of data that's all encrypted using the same key may eventually be
# able to use this to figure out the key. Is this a real practical problem? I
# have no idea, I'm not a cryptographer. In any case, some people worry that
# it's a problem, so their TLS libraries are designed to automatically trigger
# a renegotiation every once in a while on some sort of timer.
#
# The end result is that you might be going along, minding your own business,
# and then *bam*! a wild renegotiation appears! And you just have to cope.
#
# The reason that coping with renegotiations is difficult is that some
# unassuming "read" or "write" call might find itself unable to progress until
# it does a handshake, which remember is a process with multiple round
# trips. So read might have to send data, and write might have to receive
# data, and this might happen multiple times. And some of those attempts might
# fail because there isn't any data yet, and need to be retried. Managing all
# this is pretty complicated.
#
# Here's how openssl (and thus the stdlib ssl module) handle this. All of the
# I/O operations above follow the same rules. When you call one of them:
#
# - it might write some data to the outgoing BIO
# - it might read some data from the incoming BIO
# - it might raise SSLWantReadError if it can't complete without reading more
#   data from the incoming BIO. This is important: the "read" in ReadError
#   refers to reading from the *underlying* stream.
# - (and in principle it might raise SSLWantWriteError too, but that never
#   happens when using memory BIOs, so never mind)
#
# If it doesn't raise an error, then the operation completed successfully
# (though we still need to take any outgoing data out of the memory buffer and
# put it onto the wire). If it *does* raise an error, then we need to retry
# *exactly that method call* later – in particular, if a 'write' failed, we
# need to try again later *with the same data*, because openssl might have
# already committed some of the initial parts of our data to its output even
# though it didn't tell us that, and has remembered that the next time we call
# write it needs to skip the first 1024 bytes or whatever it is. (Well,
# technically, we're actually allowed to call 'write' again with a data buffer
# which is the same as our old one PLUS some extra stuff added onto the end,
# but in Trio that never comes up so never mind.)
#
# There are some people online who claim that once you've gotten a Want*Error
# then the *very next call* you make to openssl *must* be the same as the
# previous one. I'm pretty sure those people are wrong. In particular, it's
# okay to call write, get a WantReadError, and then call read a few times;
# it's just that *the next time you call write*, it has to be with the same
# data.
#
# One final wrinkle: we want our SSLStream to support full-duplex operation,
# i.e. it should be possible for one task to be calling send_all while another
# task is calling receive_some. But renegotiation makes this a big hassle, because
# even if SSLStream's restricts themselves to one task calling send_all and one
# task calling receive_some, those two tasks might end up both wanting to call
# send_all, or both to call receive_some at the same time *on the underlying
# stream*. So we have to do some careful locking to hide this problem from our
# users.
#
# (Renegotiation is evil.)
#
# So our basic strategy is to define a single helper method called "_retry",
# which has generic logic for dealing with SSLWantReadError, pushing data from
# the outgoing BIO to the wire, reading data from the wire to the incoming
# BIO, retrying an I/O call until it works, and synchronizing with other tasks
# that might be calling _retry concurrently. Basically it takes an SSLObject
# non-blocking in-memory method and converts it into a Trio async blocking
# method. _retry is only about 30 lines of code, but all these cases
# multiplied by concurrent calls make it extremely tricky, so there are lots
# of comments down below on the details, and a really extensive test suite in
# test_ssl.py. And now you know *why* it's so tricky, and can probably
# understand how it works.

# Ideally, when the user calls SSLStream.receive_some() with no argument, then
# we should do exactly one call to self.transport_stream.receive_some(),
# decrypt everything we got, and return it. Unfortunately, the way openssl's
# API works, we have to pick how much data we want to allow when we call
# read(), and then it (potentially) triggers a call to
# transport_stream.receive_some(). So at the time we pick the amount of data
# to decrypt, we don't know how much data we've read. As a simple heuristic,
# we record the max amount of data returned by previous calls to
# transport_stream.receive_some(), and we use that for future calls to read().
# But what do we use for the very first call? That's what this constant sets.
#
# Note that the value passed to read() is a limit on the amount of
# *decrypted* data, but we can only see the size of the *encrypted* data
# returned by transport_stream.receive_some(). TLS adds a small amount of
# framing overhead, and TLS compression is rarely used these days because it's
# insecure. So the size of the encrypted data should be a slight over-estimate
# of the size of the decrypted data, which is exactly what we want.
#
# The specific value is not really based on anything; it might be worth tuning
# at some point. But, if you have an TCP connection with the typical 1500 byte
# MTU and an initial window of 10 (see RFC 6928), then the initial burst of
# data will be limited to ~15000 bytes (or a bit less due to IP-level framing
# overhead), so this is chosen to be larger than that.

class SSLStream(Stream, metaclass=Final):
    r"""Encrypted communication using SSL/TLS.

    :class:`SSLStream` wraps an arbitrary :class:`~trio.abc.Stream`, and
    allows you to perform encrypted communication over it using the usual
    :class:`~trio.abc.Stream` interface. You pass regular data to
    :meth:`send_all`, then it encrypts it and sends the encrypted data on the
    underlying :class:`~trio.abc.Stream`; :meth:`receive_some` takes encrypted
    data out of the underlying :class:`~trio.abc.Stream` and decrypts it
    before returning it.

    You should read the standard library's :mod:`ssl` documentation carefully
    before attempting to use this class, and probably other general
    documentation on SSL/TLS as well. SSL/TLS is subtle and quick to
    anger. Really. I'm not kidding.

    Args:
      transport_stream (~trio.abc.Stream): The stream used to transport
          encrypted data. Required.

      ssl_context (~ssl.SSLContext): The :class:`~ssl.SSLContext` used for
          this connection. Required. Usually created by calling
          :func:`ssl.create_default_context`.

      server_hostname (str or None): The name of the server being connected
          to. Used for `SNI
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`__ and for
          validating the server's certificate (if hostname checking is
          enabled). This is effectively mandatory for clients, and actually
          mandatory if ``ssl_context.check_hostname`` is ``True``.

      server_side (bool): Whether this stream is acting as a client or
          server. Defaults to False, i.e. client mode.

      https_compatible (bool): There are two versions of SSL/TLS commonly
          encountered in the wild: the standard version, and the version used
          for HTTPS (HTTP-over-SSL/TLS).

          Standard-compliant SSL/TLS implementations always send a
          cryptographically signed ``close_notify`` message before closing the
          connection. This is important because if the underlying transport
          were simply closed, then there wouldn't be any way for the other
          side to know whether the connection was intentionally closed by the
          peer that they negotiated a cryptographic connection to, or by some
          `man-in-the-middle
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack>`__ attacker
          who can't manipulate the cryptographic stream, but can manipulate
          the transport layer (a so-called "truncation attack").

          However, this part of the standard is widely ignored by real-world
          HTTPS implementations, which means that if you want to interoperate
          with them, then you NEED to ignore it too.

          Fortunately this isn't as bad as it sounds, because the HTTP
          protocol already includes its own equivalent of ``close_notify``, so
          doing this again at the SSL/TLS level is redundant. But not all
          protocols do! Therefore, by default Trio implements the safer
          standard-compliant version (``https_compatible=False``). But if
          you're speaking HTTPS or some other protocol where
          ``close_notify``\s are commonly skipped, then you should set
          ``https_compatible=True``; with this setting, Trio will neither
          expect nor send ``close_notify`` messages.

          If you have code that was written to use :class:`ssl.SSLSocket` and
          now you're porting it to Trio, then it may be useful to know that a
          difference between :class:`SSLStream` and :class:`ssl.SSLSocket` is
          that :class:`~ssl.SSLSocket` implements the
          ``https_compatible=True`` behavior by default.

    Attributes:
      transport_stream (trio.abc.Stream): The underlying transport stream
          that was passed to ``__init__``. An example of when this would be
          useful is if you're using :class:`SSLStream` over a
          :class:`~trio.SocketStream` and want to call the
          :class:`~trio.SocketStream`'s :meth:`~trio.SocketStream.setsockopt`
          method.

    Internally, this class is implemented using an instance of
    :class:`ssl.SSLObject`, and all of :class:`~ssl.SSLObject`'s methods and
    attributes are re-exported as methods and attributes on this class.
    However, there is one difference: :class:`~ssl.SSLObject` has several
    methods that return information about the encrypted connection, like
    :meth:`~ssl.SSLSocket.cipher` or
    :meth:`~ssl.SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol`. If you call them before the
    handshake, when they can't possibly return useful data, then
    :class:`ssl.SSLObject` returns None, but :class:`trio.SSLStream`
    raises :exc:`NeedHandshakeError`.

    This also means that if you register a SNI callback using
    `~ssl.SSLContext.sni_callback`, then the first argument your callback
    receives will be a :class:`ssl.SSLObject`.

            # Now we need to move things forward. There are two things we
            # might have to do, and any given operation might require
            # either, both, or neither to proceed:
            #
            # - send the data in to_send
            #
            # - receive_some some data and put it into the incoming BIO
            #
            # Our strategy is: if there's data to send, send it;
            # *otherwise* if there's data to receive_some, receive_some it.
            #
            # If both need to happen, then we only send. Why? Well, we
            # know that *right now* we have to both send and receive_some
            # before the operation can complete. But as soon as we yield,
            # that information becomes potentially stale – e.g. while
            # we're sending, some other task might go and receive_some the
            # data we need and put it into the incoming BIO. And if it
            # does, then we *definitely don't* want to do a receive_some –
            # there might not be any more data coming, and we'd deadlock!
            # We could do something tricky to keep track of whether a
            # receive_some happens while we're sending, but the case where
            # we have to do both is very unusual (only during a
            # renegotiation), so it's better to keep things simple. So we
            # do just one potentially-blocking operation, then check again
            # for fresh information.
            #
            # And we prioritize sending over receiving because, if there
            # are multiple tasks that want to receive_some, then it
            # doesn't matter what order they go in. But if there are
            # multiple tasks that want to send, then they each have

            # BIO. So if we have data to send, that *needs* to be the
