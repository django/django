The Trio project's goal is to produce a production-quality, `permissively
licensed <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/blob/master/LICENSE>`__,
async/await-native I/O library for Python. Like all async libraries,
its main purpose is to help you write programs that do **multiple
things at the same time** with **parallelized I/O**. A web spider that
wants to fetch lots of pages in parallel, a web server that needs to
juggle lots of downloads and websocket connections at the same time, a
process supervisor monitoring multiple subprocesses... that sort of
thing. Compared to other libraries, Trio attempts to distinguish
itself with an obsessive focus on **usability** and
**correctness**. Concurrency is complicated; we try to make it *easy*
to get things *right*.

Trio was built from the ground up to take advantage of the `latest
Python features <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/>`__, and
draws inspiration from `many sources
<https://github.com/python-trio/trio/wiki/Reading-list>`__, in
particular Dave Beazley's `Curio <https://curio.readthedocs.io/>`__.
The resulting design is radically simpler than older competitors like
`asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__ and
`Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`__, yet just as capable. Trio is
the Python I/O library I always wanted; I find it makes building
I/O-oriented programs easier, less error-prone, and just plain more
fun. `Perhaps you'll find the same
<https://github.com/python-trio/trio/wiki/Testimonials>`__.

This project is young and still somewhat experimental: the overall
design is solid and the existing features are fully tested and
documented, but you may encounter missing functionality or rough
edges. We *do* encourage you do use it, but you should `read and
subscribe to issue #1
<https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/1>`__ to get warning and a
chance to give feedback about any compatibility-breaking changes.

Vital statistics:

* Supported environments: Linux, macOS, or Windows running some kind of Python
  3.8-or-better (either CPython or PyPy3 is fine). \*BSD and illumos likely
  work too, but are not tested.

* Install: ``python3 -m pip install -U trio`` (or on Windows, maybe
  ``py -3 -m pip install -U trio``). No compiler needed.
