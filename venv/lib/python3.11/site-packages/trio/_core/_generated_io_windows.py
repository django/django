    Call this before closing a file descriptor (on Unix) or socket (on

    calls on the given object to immediately wake up and raise
    `~trio.ClosedResourceError`.

    This doesn't actually close the object – you still have to do that
    yourself afterwards. Also, you want to be careful to make sure no
    new tasks start waiting on the object in between when you call this
    and when it's actually closed. So to close something properly, you
    usually want to do these steps in order:

    1. Explicitly mark the object as closed, so that any new attempts
       to use it will abort before they start.
    2. Call `notify_closing` to wake up any already-existing users.
    3. Actually close the object.

    It's also possible to do them in a different order if that's more
    convenient, *but only if* you make sure not to have any checkpoints in
    between the steps. This way they all happen in a single atomic
    step, so other tasks won't be able to tell what order they happened
    in anyway.
