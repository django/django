;; xindy base module latex.xdy loads tex.xdy and the latter instructs
;; xindy to ignore **all** TeX macros in .idx entries, except those
;; explicitly described in merge rule.  But when after applying all
;; merge rules an empty string results, xindy raises an error:

;;   ERROR: CHAR: index 0 should be less than the length of the string

;; For example when using pdflatex with utf-8 characters the index
;; file will contain \IeC macros and they will get ignored except if
;; suitable merge rules are loaded early.  The texindy script coming
;; with xindy provides this, but only for Latin scripts.  The texindy
;; man page says to use rather xelatex or lualatex in case of Cyrillic
;; scripts.

;; Sphinx contributes LICRcyr2utf8.xdy to provide support for Cyrillic
;; scripts for the pdflatex engine.

;; Another issue caused by xindy ignoring all TeX macros except those
;; explicitly declared reveals itself when attempting to index ">>>",
;; as the ">" is converted to "\textgreater{}" by Sphinx's LaTeX
;; escaping.

;; To fix this, Sphinx does **not** use texindy, and does not even
;; load the xindy latex.xdy base module.

;(require "latex.xdy")

;; Rather it incorporates some suitable extracts from latex.xdy and
;; tex.xdy with additional Sphinx contributed rules.

;; But, this means for pdflatex and Latin scripts that the xindy file
;; tex/inputenc/uf8.xdy is not usable because it refers to the macro
;; \IeC only sporadically, and as tex.xdy is not loaded, a rule such as
;;     (merge-rule "\'e" "é" :string)
;; does not work, it must be
;;     (merge-rule "\IeC {\'e}" "é" :string)
;; So Sphinx contributes LICRlatin2utf8.xdy to mitigate that problem.
