/**
 * Thread-local state of greenlets.
 *
 * Each native thread will get exactly one of these objects,
 * automatically accessed through the best available thread-local
 * mechanism the compiler supports (``thread_local`` for C++11
 * compilers or ``__thread``/``declspec(thread)`` for older GCC/clang
 * or MSVC, respectively.)
 *
 * Previously, we kept thread-local state mostly in a bunch of
 * ``static volatile`` variables in the main greenlet file.. This had
 * the problem of requiring extra checks, loops, and great care
 * accessing these variables if we potentially invoked any Python code
 * that could release the GIL, because the state could change out from
 * under us. Making the variables thread-local solves this problem.
 *
 * When we detected that a greenlet API accessing the current greenlet
 * was invoked from a different thread than the greenlet belonged to,
 * we stored a reference to the greenlet in the Python thread
 * dictionary for the thread the greenlet belonged to. This could lead
 * to memory leaks if the thread then exited (because of a reference
 * cycle, as greenlets referred to the thread dictionary, and deleting
 * non-current greenlets leaked their frame plus perhaps arguments on
 * the C stack). If a thread exited while still having running
 * greenlet objects (perhaps that had just switched back to the main
 * greenlet), and did not invoke one of the greenlet APIs *in that
 * thread, immediately before it exited, without some other thread
 * then being invoked*, such a leak was guaranteed.
 *
 * This can be partly solved by using compiler thread-local variables
 * instead of the Python thread dictionary, thus avoiding a cycle.
 *
 * To fully solve this problem, we need a reliable way to know that a
 * thread is done and we should clean up the main greenlet. On POSIX,
 * we can use the destructor function of ``pthread_key_create``, but
 * there's nothing similar on Windows; a C++11 thread local object
 * reliably invokes its destructor when the thread it belongs to exits
 * (non-C++11 compilers offer ``__thread`` or ``declspec(thread)`` to
 * create thread-local variables, but they can't hold C++ objects that
 * invoke destructors; the C++11 version is the most portable solution
 * I found). When the thread exits, we can drop references and
 * otherwise manipulate greenlets and frames that we know can no
 * longer be switched to.
 *
 * There are two small wrinkles. The first is that when the thread
 * exits, it is too late to actually invoke Python APIs: the Python
 * thread state is gone, and the GIL is released. To solve *this*
 * problem, our destructor uses ``Py_AddPendingCall`` to transfer the
 * destruction work to the main thread.
 *
 * The second is that once the thread exits, the thread local object
 * is invalid and we can't even access a pointer to it, so we can't
 * pass it to ``Py_AddPendingCall``. This is handled by actually using
 * a second object that's thread local (ThreadStateCreator) and having
 * it dynamically allocate this object so it can live until the
 * pending call runs.
