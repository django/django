# graphviz 0.18 (Nov 7 2021), available only on Python 3.6 and newer,
# has added type hints (sigh). It wants to use ``typing.Literal`` for
# some stuff, but that's only available on Python 3.9+. If that's not
# found, it creates a ``unittest.mock.MagicMock`` object and annotates
# with that. These are GC'able objects, and doing almost *anything*
# with them results in an explosion of objects. For example, trying to
# compare them for equality creates new objects. This causes our
# leakchecks to fail, with reports like:
#
# greenlet.tests.leakcheck.LeakCheckError: refcount increased by [337, 1333, 343, 430, 530, 643, 769]
# _Call          1820      +546

#
# To avoid this, we *could* filter this type of object out early. In
# principle it could leak, but we don't use mocks in greenlet, so it
# doesn't leak from us. However, a further issue is that ``MagicMock``
# objects have subobjects that are also GC'able, like ``_Call``, and
# those create new mocks of their own too. So we'd have to filter them
# as well, and they're not public. That's OK, we can workaround the
# problem by being very careful to never compare by equality or other
# user-defined operators, only using object identity or other builtin
# functions.
