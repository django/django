 * HISTORY
 * 07-Sep-05 (py-dev mailing list discussion)
 *      removed 'r31' from the register-saved.  !!!! WARNING !!!!
 *      It means that this file can no longer be compiled statically!
 *      It is now only suitable as part of a dynamic library!
 * 14-Jan-04  Bob Ippolito <bob@redivi.com>
 *      added cr2-cr4 to the registers to be saved.
 *      Open questions: Should we save FP registers?
 *      What about vector registers?
 *      Differences between darwin and unix?
 * 24-Nov-02  Christian Tismer  <tismer@tismer.com>
 *      needed to add another magic constant to insure
 *      that f in slp_eval_frame(PyFrameObject *f)
 *      STACK_REFPLUS will probably be 1 in most cases.
 *      gets included into the saved stack area.
 * 04-Oct-02  Gustavo Niemeyer <niemeyer@conectiva.com>
 *      Ported from MacOS version.
 * 17-Sep-02  Christian Tismer  <tismer@tismer.com>
 *      after virtualizing stack save/restore, the
 *      stack size shrunk a bit. Needed to introduce
 *      an adjustment STACK_MAGIC per platform.
 * 15-Sep-02  Gerd Woetzel       <gerd.woetzel@GMD.DE>
 *      slightly changed framework for sparc
 * 29-Jun-02  Christian Tismer  <tismer@tismer.com>
 *      Added register 13-29, 31 saves. The same way as
 *      Armin Rigo did for the x86_unix version.
 *      This seems to be now fully functional!
 * 04-Mar-02  Hye-Shik Chang  <perky@fallin.lv>
 *      Ported from i386.
 * 31-Jul-12  Trevor Bowen    <trevorbowen@gmail.com>
 *      Changed memory constraints to register only.
