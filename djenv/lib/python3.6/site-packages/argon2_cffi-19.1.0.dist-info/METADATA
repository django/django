`Argon2 <https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2>`_ won the `Password Hashing Competition <https://password-hashing.net/>`_ and ``argon2_cffi`` is the simplest way to use it in Python and PyPy:

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from argon2 import PasswordHasher
  >>> ph = PasswordHasher()
  >>> hash = ph.hash("s3kr3tp4ssw0rd")
  >>> hash  # doctest: +SKIP
  '$argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$tSm+JOWigOgPZx/g44K5fQ$WDyus6py50bVFIPkjA28lQ'
  >>> ph.verify(hash, "s3kr3tp4ssw0rd")
  True
  >>> ph.check_needs_rehash(hash)
  False
  >>> ph.verify(hash, "t0t411ywr0ng")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  argon2.exceptions.VerifyMismatchError: The password does not match the supplied hash


.. note::
   `passlib <https://pypi.org/project/passlib/>`_ 1.7.0 and later offers `Argon2 support <https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.argon2.html>`_ using this library too.

``argon2_cffi``\ ’s documentation lives at `Read the Docs <https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/>`_, the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/hynek/argon2_cffi>`_.
It’s rigorously tested on Python 2.7, 3.4+, and PyPy.

Vendored Code

Argon2
^^^^^^

The original Argon2 repo can be found at https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/.

Except for the components listed below, the Argon2 code in this repository is copyright (c) 2015 Daniel Dinu, Dmitry Khovratovich (main authors), Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Samuel Neves, and under CC0_ license.

The string encoding routines in src/encoding.c are copyright (c) 2015 Thomas Pornin, and under CC0_ license.

The `BLAKE2 <https://blake2.net>`_ code in ``src/blake2/`` is copyright (c) Samuel Neves, 2013-2015, and under CC0_ license.

The authors of Argon2 also were very helpful to get the library to compile on ancient versions of Visual Studio for ancient versions of Python.

The documentation also quotes frequently from the Argon2 paper_ to avoid mistakes by rephrasing.

msinttypes
^^^^^^^^^^

In order to be able to compile on Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 which are required for Python 2.7 and 3.4 respectively, we also ship two C headers with integer types.
They are from the `msinttypes project <https://code.google.com/archive/p/msinttypes>`_ (`auto-import on GitHub <https://github.com/chemeris/msinttypes>`_) and licensed under New BSD:
