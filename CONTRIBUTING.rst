======================
Contributing to Django
======================

As an open source project, Django welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code contributions
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and code reviews

Extensive contribution guidelines are available in the repository at
``docs/internals/contributing/``, or online at:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/

**Warning: non-trivial pull requests (anything more than fixing a typo) without
Trac tickets will be closed!** `Please file a ticket`__ to suggest changes.

__ https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket

Django uses Trac to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
code contributions. Code contributions can be submitted as pull requests,
but if you don't file a ticket, it's unlikely that we'll notice your
contribution.

Code of Conduct
===============

As a contributor, you can help us keep the Django community open and inclusive.
Please read and follow our `Code of Conduct <https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/>`_.
