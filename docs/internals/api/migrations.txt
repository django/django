``django.db.migrations``
========================

This section outlines the components of Django's migrations framework and how
they play together.

.. currentmodule:: django.db.migrations.state

``ProjectState`` and ``ModelState``
-----------------------------------

The heart of Django's migrations framework are the ``ProjectState``\s and
``ModelState``\s. A ``ModelState`` represents an exact replica of a model at a
certain point in time. This includes all the fields with all their attributes,
the model's base classes, and the model's meta options, such as ``db_table``,
``index_together``, ``order_with_respect_to``, and ``unique_together``.
Furthermore, all model managers that are marked to be used in migrations are
available as well.

.. class:: ProjectState(models=None, real_apps=None)

A ``ProjectState`` is a collection of all models at a certain point in time. It
consists of the ``ModelState``\s of all models of apps with migrations, as well
as a list of all apps without migrations.

.. class:: ModelState(app_label, name, fields, options=None, bases=None, managers=None)

Additionally, a ``ProjectState`` has an ``apps`` property  (lazily created upon
first access) that proxies the global app registry from ``django.apps.apps``.
Furthermore, when accessing ``project_state.apps`` for the first time -- it's a
``cached_property`` -- all models for the apps without migrations and apps with
migrations are *rendered*, using the newly created ``StateApps`` instance,
which makes it a quite expensive operation.

Reloading models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever the migrations framework needs to add or remove a model to or from a
``ProjectState`` (a rename would be remove + add), the respective
``ModelState``\s will be added or removed.

Changes to models' ``_meta`` attributes, such as ``index_together`` or
``db_table``, as well as updates of the model managers, reuse the existing
``ModelState`` and only updates the respective attributes.

The ``Field`` operations (e.g. ``AddField`` and ``AlterField``) alter the
``fields`` attribute on a ``ModelState`` and reuse the existing ``ModelState``
instance.

.. warning::

    The ``Field`` instances in the ``ModelState.fields`` attribute must not be
    altered in any way. Those instances are reused across cloned
    ``ModelState``\s for performance reasons. Therefore **always** replace a
    ``Field`` instance with a new instance with adjusted attributes.

Regardless of the reason for reloading a model, if the ``apps`` property of the
``ProjectState`` is already populated all models related to the just added /
removed one need to be *reloaded*.

``get_related_models_recursive``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: get_related_models_recursive(model)

Takes a model class and recursively follows all relationships defined on this
model or leading to that model.

Relationships are either defined by explicit relational fields, like
``ForeignKey``, ``ManyToManyField``, or ``OneToOneField``, or by inheriting
from another model (a superclass is related to its subclasses, but not vice
versa). Note, however, that a model inheriting from a concrete model is also
related to its superclass through the implicit ``*_ptr` ``OneToOneField`` on
the subclass.

This rather expensive method is used when reloading models when ``apps`` is
already populated. This is the only way to keep the ``StateApps`` registry
consistent with the references between the model classes.

Rendering models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: StateApps(real_apps, models, ignore_swappable=False)

In order to create the SQL code to alter the database, the database schema API
needs actual model classes. Those model classes are dynamically constructed
from the ``ModelState``\s which we call "rendering". That means,
``projectState.apps`` is being populated with model classes with all models as
of their state before the first migration operation is being run.

While "normal models" (those from the ``models.py`` files) are kept in the
global :ref:`application-registry`, the rendered models are kept in
``StateApps`` instances. This subclass of ``django.apps.Apps`` allows for
reloading and removal of models (something regular users should never do) as
well as keeping track of models form apps with and without migrations. It also
offers to render multiple models at once.

Let's assume you have the following simplified migrations::

    someapp.0001_initial:
        CreateModel(ModelA)
        CreateModel(ModelB)

    someapp.0002_delete_modelb:
        DeleteModel(ModelB)

    someapp.0003_create_modelc:
        CreateModel(ModelC)

    someapp.0004_create_modeld:
        CreateModel(ModelD)

If you start off with an empty database, Django's migrations framework will go
through all migrations in your project and create the
``ProjectState``\s right before the first operation of each migration. Thus
Django will have 4 ``ProjectState``\s:

1. Before ``someapp.0001_initial`` without any ``ModelState``
2. Before ``someapp.0002_delete_modelb`` with ``ModelA`` and ``ModelB``
3. Before ``someapp.0003_create_modelc`` with ``ModelA``
4. Before ``someapp.0004_create_modeld`` with ``ModelA`` and ``ModelC``

Now assume ``someapp.0001_initial`` and ``someapp.0002_delete_modelb`` are
already applied. Django will only render the ``ProjectState``\s before
``someapp.0003_create_modelc`` and ``someapp.0004_create_modeld``:

1. Before ``someapp.0003_create_modelc`` with ``ModelA``
2. Before ``someapp.0004_create_modeld`` with ``ModelA`` and ``ModelC``

If all model migrations are applied, Django won't render any ``ModelState``\s.

Cloning states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve the performance of the migrations framework, the ``ProjectState``,
``ModelState``, and ``StateApps`` instances are ``cloned``.

.. method:: ProjectState.clone()

Clones all of its associated ``ModelState``\s and copies the list of apps
without migrations. The latter does not need to be immutable, as the list of
apps without migrations is a project-wide definition, unrelated to the
migrations framework.

.. method:: ModelState.clone()

When cloning, Django creates a new instance of the class with all attributes,
like ``app_label``, ``name``, ``fields``, ``options``, copied. While ``list``
and ``dict`` attributes are wrapped in ``list()`` and ``dict()``, this does not
prevent modifications of nested mutable objects. Thus migration operations need
not to make changes that affect more then only the currently worked on
``ModelState``.

.. method:: StateApps.clone()

Cloning a ``StateApps`` instance :func:`deepcopies<copy.deepcopy>` all its
models and app configs. This, in turn, copies the actual model instances and
all their fields in a memory and CPU efficient way.

Creating a ``ModelState`` from a ``Model`` class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. classmethod:: ModelState.from_model(model, exclude_rels=False)

The core method to turn a model class into a ``ModelState`` is
``ModelState.from_model()``
