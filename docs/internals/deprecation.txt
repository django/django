===========================
Django Deprecation Timeline
===========================

This document outlines when various pieces of Django will be removed or altered
in a backward incompatible way, following their deprecation, as per the
:ref:`deprecation policy <internal-release-deprecation-policy>`. More details
about each item can often be found in the release notes of two versions prior.

1.7
---

See the :doc:`Django 1.5 release notes</releases/1.5>` for more details on
these changes.

* The module ``django.utils.simplejson`` will be removed. The standard library
  provides :mod:`json` which should be used instead.

* The function ``django.utils.itercompat.product`` will be removed. The Python
  builtin version should be used instead.

* Auto-correction of INSTALLED_APPS and TEMPLATE_DIRS settings when they are
  specified as a plain string instead of a tuple will be removed and raise an
  exception.

* The ``mimetype`` argument to the ``__init__`` methods of
  :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse`,
  :class:`~django.template.response.SimpleTemplateResponse`, and
  :class:`~django.template.response.TemplateResponse`, will be removed.
  ``content_type`` should be used instead. This also applies to the
  :func:`~django.shortcuts.render_to_response` shortcut and
  the sitemap views, :func:`~django.contrib.sitemaps.views.index` and
  :func:`~django.contrib.sitemaps.views.sitemap`.

* When :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse` is instantiated with an iterator,
  or when :attr:`~django.http.HttpResponse.content` is set to an iterator,
  that iterator will be immediately consumed.

* The ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting, and the ``get_profile()`` method on
  the User model, will be removed.

* The ``cleanup`` management command will be removed. It's replaced by
  ``clearsessions``.

* The ``daily_cleanup.py`` script will be removed.

* The ``depth`` keyword argument will be removed from
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related`.

* The undocumented ``get_warnings_state()``/``restore_warnings_state()``
  functions from :mod:`django.test.utils` and the ``save_warnings_state()``/
  ``restore_warnings_state()``
  :ref:`django.test.*TestCase <django-testcase-subclasses>` methods are
  deprecated. Use the :class:`warnings.catch_warnings` context manager
  available starting with Python 2.6 instead.

* The undocumented ``check_for_test_cookie`` method in
  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm` will be removed
  following an accelerated deprecation. Users subclassing this form should
  remove calls to this method, and instead ensure that their auth related views
  are CSRF protected, which ensures that cookies are enabled.

* The version of :func:`django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm` that
  supports base36 encoded user IDs
  (``django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm_uidb36``) will be
  removed. If your site has been running Django 1.6 for more than
  :setting:`PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS`, this change will have no effect. If
  not, then any password reset links generated before you upgrade to Django 1.7
  won't work after the upgrade.

1.8
---

* ``django.contrib.comments`` will be removed.

* The following transaction management APIs will be removed:

  - ``TransactionMiddleware``,
  - the decorators and context managers ``autocommit``, ``commit_on_success``,
    and ``commit_manually``, defined in ``django.db.transaction``,
  - the functions ``commit_unless_managed`` and ``rollback_unless_managed``,
    also defined in ``django.db.transaction``,
  - the ``TRANSACTIONS_MANAGED`` setting.

  Upgrade paths are described in the :ref:`transaction management docs
  <transactions-upgrading-from-1.5>`.

* The :ttag:`cycle` and :ttag:`firstof` template tags will auto-escape their
  arguments. In 1.6 and 1.7, this behavior is provided by the version of these
  tags in the ``future`` template tag library.

* The ``SEND_BROKEN_LINK_EMAILS`` setting will be removed. Add the
  :class:`django.middleware.common.BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware` middleware to
  your :setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting instead.

* ``Model._meta.module_name`` was renamed to ``model_name``.

* Remove the backward compatible shims introduced to rename ``get_query_set``
  and similar queryset methods. This affects the following classes:
  ``BaseModelAdmin``, ``ChangeList``, ``BaseCommentNode``,
  ``GenericForeignKey``, ``Manager``, ``SingleRelatedObjectDescriptor`` and
  ``ReverseSingleRelatedObjectDescriptor``.

* Remove the backward compatible shims introduced to rename the attributes
  ``ChangeList.root_query_set`` and ``ChangeList.query_set``.

* ``django.views.defaults.shortcut`` will be removed, as part of the
  goal of removing all ``django.contrib`` references from the core
  Django codebase. Instead use
  ``django.contrib.contenttypes.views.shortcut``. ``django.conf.urls.shortcut``
  will also be removed.

* Support for the Python Imaging Library (PIL) module will be removed, as it
  no longer appears to be actively maintained & does not work on Python 3.
  You are advised to install `Pillow`_, which should be used instead.

  .. _`Pillow`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow

* The following private APIs will be removed:

  - ``django.db.backend``
  - ``django.db.close_connection()``
  - ``django.db.backends.creation.BaseDatabaseCreation.set_autocommit()``
  - ``django.db.transaction.is_managed()``
  - ``django.db.transaction.managed()``

* ``django.forms.widgets.RadioInput`` will be removed in favor of
  ``django.forms.widgets.RadioChoiceInput``.

* The module ``django.test.simple`` and the class
  ``django.test.simple.DjangoTestSuiteRunner`` will be removed. Instead use
  ``django.test.runner.DiscoverRunner``.

* The module ``django.test._doctest`` will be removed. Instead use the doctest
  module from the Python standard library.

* The ``CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ANONYMOUS_ONLY`` setting will be removed.

* Usage of the hard-coded *Hold down "Control", or "Command" on a Mac, to select
  more than one.* string to override or append to user-provided ``help_text`` in
  forms for ManyToMany model fields will not be performed by Django anymore
  either at the model or forms layer.

* The ``Model._meta.get_(add|change|delete)_permission`` methods will
  be removed.

* The session key ``django_language`` will no longer be read for backwards
  compatibility.

* Geographic Sitemaps will be removed
  (``django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.index`` and
  ``django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.sitemap``).

1.9
---

* ``django.utils.dictconfig`` will be removed.

* ``django.utils.importlib`` will be removed.

* ``django.utils.tzinfo`` will be removed.

* ``django.utils.unittest`` will be removed.

* The ``syncdb`` command will be removed.

* ``django.db.models.signals.pre_syncdb`` and
  ``django.db.models.signals.post_syncdb`` will be removed.

* ``allow_syncdb`` on database routers will no longer automatically become
  ``allow_migrate``.

* All models will need to be defined inside an installed application or
  declare an explicit :attr:`~django.db.models.Options.app_label`.
  Furthermore, it won't be possible to import them before their application
  is loaded. In particular, it won't be possible to import models inside
  the root package of their application.

* If models are organized in a package, Django will no longer look for
  :ref:`initial SQL data<initial-sql>` in ``myapp/models/sql/``. Move your
  custom SQL files to ``myapp/sql/``.

* The model and form ``IPAddressField`` will be removed.

* ``AppCommand.handle_app()`` will no longer be supported.

* FastCGI support via the ``runfcgi`` management command will be
  removed. Please deploy your project using WSGI.

* ``django.utils.datastructures.SortedDict`` will be removed. Use
  :class:`collections.OrderedDict` from the Python standard library instead.

* ``ModelAdmin.declared_fieldsets`` will be removed.

* Instances of ``util.py`` in the Django codebase have been renamed to
  ``utils.py`` in an effort to unify all util and utils references.
  The modules that provided backwards compatibility will be removed:

  * ``django.contrib.admin.util``
  * ``django.contrib.gis.db.backends.util``
  * ``django.db.backends.util``
  * ``django.forms.util``

* ``ModelAdmin.get_formsets`` will be removed.

  ``BaseMemcachedCache._get_memcache_timeout()`` method to
  ``get_backend_timeout()``.

  Use :djadminopt:`--natural-foreign` instead.

  removed.

* The ``WSGIRequest.REQUEST`` property will be removed.

  replaced by the ``zh-hans`` and ``zh-hant`` language code respectively.

* The internal ``django.utils.functional.memoize`` will be removed.

* ``django.core.cache.get_cache`` will be removed. Add suitable entries
  to :setting:`CACHES` and use :data:`django.core.cache.caches` instead.

* ``django.db.models.loading`` will be removed.

* Passing callable arguments to querysets will no longer be possible.

* ``BaseCommand.requires_model_validation`` will be removed in favor of

  attribute.
