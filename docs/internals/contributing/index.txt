Contributing to Django
======================

Django is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either
on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

Communication channels
======================

We're passionate about helping Django users make the jump to contributing
members of the community. Communication is key - working on Django is being
part of a conversation. Join it, to become familiar with what we're doing and
how we talk about it. You'll be able to form relationships with more
experienced contributors who are there to help guide you towards success.

Join the Django community
-------------------------

There are several ways you can help the Django community and others to maintain
a great ecosystem to work in:

* Join the `Django forum`_. This forum is a place for discussing the Django
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Django.

* Join the |django-users| mailing list and answer questions. This
  mailing list has a huge audience, and we really want to maintain a
  friendly and helpful atmosphere. If you're new to the Django community,
  you should read the `posting guidelines`_.

* Join the `Django Discord server`_ or the `#django IRC channel`_ on
  Libera.Chat to discuss and answer questions. By explaining Django to other
  users, you're going to learn a lot about the framework yourself.

* Blog about Django. We syndicate all the Django blogs we know about on
  the `community page`_; if you'd like to see your blog on that page you
  can `register it here`_.

* Contribute to open-source Django projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Django, help us
  build it!

Getting started
===============

Django encourages and welcomes new contributors, and makes an effort to help
them become experienced, confident contributors to Open Source Software (OSS).
Our documentation contains guidance for first-time contributors, including:

Work on the Django framework
============================

If you enjoy working *with* Django, wait until you start working *on* it.
Really, **anyone** can do something to improve Django, which will improve the
experience of lots of people!

The work on Django itself falls into three major areas:

Contributing code
-----------------

Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
code** in the next version of Django.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   writing-code/index

Contributing documentation
--------------------------

Django's documentation is one of its key strengths. It's informative and
thorough. You can help to improve the documentation and keep it relevant as the
framework evolves.

Localizing Django
-----------------

Django is translated into over 100 languages - There's even some translation
for Klingon?! The i18n team is always looking for translators to help maintain
and increase language reach.

Other ways of contributing
==========================

Explore additional avenues of contributing to Django beyond coding. Django's
`ticket tracker`_ is the central hub for managing issues, improvements, and
contributions to Django. It's a valuable resource where you can report bugs you
encounter or assist in triaging existing tickets to ensure a smooth development
workflow. Explore the ways you can make a difference below, and join us in
making Django better for everyone.
