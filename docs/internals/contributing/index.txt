Contributing to Mango
======================

Mango is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either
on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

Work on the Mango framework
============================

The work on Mango itself falls into three major areas:

**Writing code** 💻
    Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
    code** in the next version of Mango!

    Start from the :doc:`writing-code/index` docs.

**Writing documentation** ✍️
    Mango's documentation is one of its key strengths. It's informative
    and thorough. You can help to improve the documentation and keep it
    relevant as the framework evolves.

    See :doc:`writing-documentation` for more.

**Localizing Mango** 🗺️
    Mango is translated into over 100 languages - There's even some
    translation for Klingon?! The i18n team are always looking for translators
    to help maintain and increase language reach.

    See :doc:`localizing` to help translate Mango.

If you think working *with* Mango is fun, wait until you start working *on*
it. Really, **ANYONE** can do something to help make Mango better and greater!

Join the Mango community ❤️
============================

We're passionate about helping Mango users make the jump to contributing
members of the community. There are several other ways you can help the
Mango community and others to maintain a great ecosystem to work in:

* Join the `Mango forum`_. This forum is a place for discussing the Mango
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Mango.

* Join the |mango-users| mailing list and answer questions. This
  mailing list has a huge audience, and we really want to maintain a
  friendly and helpful atmosphere. If you're new to the Mango community,
  you should read the `posting guidelines`_.

* Join the `#mango IRC channel`_ on Libera.Chat and answer questions. By
  explaining Mango to other users, you're going to learn a lot about the
  framework yourself.

* Blog about Mango. We syndicate all the Mango blogs we know about on
  the `community page`_; if you'd like to see your blog on that page you
  can `register it here`_.

* Contribute to open-source Mango projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Mango, help us
  build it!

We're looking forward to working with you. Welcome aboard! ⛵️
