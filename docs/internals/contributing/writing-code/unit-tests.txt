==========
Unit tests
==========

Django comes with a test suite of its own, in the ``tests`` directory of the
code base. It's our policy to make sure all tests pass at all times.

The tests cover:

* Models and the database API (``tests/modeltests``),
* Everything else in core Django code (``tests/regressiontests``),
* :ref:`contrib-apps` (``django/contrib/<app>/tests`` or
  ``tests/regressiontests/<app>_...``).

We appreciate any and all contributions to the test suite!

The Django tests all use the testing infrastructure that ships with Django for
testing applications. See :doc:`Testing Django applications
</topics/testing/overview>` for an explanation of how to write new tests.

Running the unit tests
----------------------

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

Running the tests requires a Django settings module that defines the
databases to use. To make it easy to get started, Django provides a
sample settings module that uses the SQLite database. To run the tests
with this sample ``settings`` module, ``cd`` into the Django
``tests/`` directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite

If you get an ``ImportError: No module named django.contrib`` error,
you need to add your install of Django to your ``PYTHONPATH``.

.. _running-unit-tests-settings:

Using another ``settings`` module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included settings module allows you to run the test suite using
SQLite. If you want to test behavior using a different database (and
if you're proposing patches for Django, it's a good idea to test
across databases), you may need to define your own settings file.

To run the tests with different settings, ``cd`` to the ``tests/`` directory
and type:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.django.settings

The :setting:`DATABASES` setting in this test settings module needs to define
two databases:

* A ``default`` database. This database should use the backend that
  you want to use for primary testing

* A database with the alias ``other``. The ``other`` database is
  used to establish that queries can be directed to different
  databases. As a result, this database can use any backend you
  want. It doesn't need to use the same backend as the ``default``
  database (although it can use the same backend if you want to).

If you're using a backend that isn't SQLite, you will need to provide other
details for each database:

* The :setting:`USER` option for each of your databases needs to
  specify an existing user account for the database.

* The :setting:`PASSWORD` option needs to provide the password for
  the :setting:`USER` that has been specified.

* The :setting:`NAME` option must be the name of an existing database to
  which the given user has permission to connect. The unit tests will not
  touch this database; the test runner creates a new database whose name
  is :setting:`NAME` prefixed with ``test_``, and this test database is
  deleted when the tests are finished. This means your user account needs
  permission to execute ``CREATE DATABASE``.

You will also need to ensure that your database uses UTF-8 as the default
character set. If your database server doesn't use UTF-8 as a default charset,
you will need to include a value for :setting:`TEST_CHARSET` in the settings
dictionary for the applicable database.

Running only some of the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django's entire test suite takes a while to run, and running every single test
could be redundant if, say, you just added a test to Django that you want to
run quickly without running everything else. You can run a subset of the unit
tests by appending the names of the test modules to ``runtests.py`` on the
command line.

For example, if you'd like to run tests only for generic relations and
internationalization, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings generic_relations i18n

How do you find out the names of individual tests? Look in
``tests/modeltests`` and ``tests/regressiontests`` — each directory name
there is the name of a test. Contrib app names are also valid test names.

If you just want to run a particular class of tests, you can specify a list of
paths to individual test classes. For example, to run the ``TranslationTests``
of the ``i18n`` module, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.TranslationTests

Going beyond that, you can specify an individual test method like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.TranslationTests.test_lazy_objects

Running the Selenium tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some admin tests require Selenium 2, Firefox and Python >= 2.6 to work via a
real Web browser. To allow those tests to run and not be skipped, you must
install the selenium_ package (version > 2.13) into your Python path.

Then, run the tests normally, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite admin_inlines

If you have Selenium installed but for some reason don't want to run these tests
(for example to speed up the test suite), use the ``--skip-selenium`` option
of the test runner.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite --skip-selenium admin_inlines


.. _running-unit-tests-dependencies:

Running all the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to run the full suite of tests, you'll need to install a number of
dependencies:

*  PyYAML_
*  setuptools_
*  memcached_, plus a :ref:`supported Python binding <memcached>`
*  gettext_ (:ref:`gettext_on_windows`)
*  selenium_ (if also using Python >= 2.6)

If you want to test the memcached cache backend, you'll also need to define
a :setting:`CACHES` setting that points at your memcached instance.

Each of these dependencies is optional. If you're missing any of them, the
associated tests will be skipped.

.. _PyYAML: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/
.. _memcached: http://memcached.org/
.. _gettext: http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
.. _selenium: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium

Code coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contributors are encouraged to run coverage on the test suite to identify areas
that need additional tests. The coverage tool installation and use is described
in :ref:`testing code coverage<topics-testing-code-coverage>`.

To run coverage on the Django test suite using the standard test settings::

    coverage run ./runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite

After running coverage, generate the html report by running::

    coverage html

When running coverage for the Django tests, the included ``.coveragerc``
settings file  defines ``coverage_html`` as the output directory for the report
and also excludes several directories not relevant to the results
(test code or external code included in Django).

Continuous integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While contributing to Django it can be useful to test your code using a
continuous integration server. This allows for automated testing using a
combination of Python versions and databases. Two common platforms for this
are :ref:`jenkins` and :ref:`travis`, for which detailed instructions are
provided below.

Databases
^^^^^^^^^

To test django with a continuous integration server, configure your server to
setup your choice of database servers. You will then need to make sure the
dj-database-url_ package is installed on your server. This package allows
configuring django :setting:`DATABASES` settings based on environment
variables, allowing for convenient tests in multiple database environments.

To communicate to the tests which database & login credentials to use, an
environment variable called ``DEFAULT_DB_URL`` is required, according to
following structure::

   export DEFAULT_DB_URL=SCHEME://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER_NAME:PORT/DATABASE_NAME

Where:

* `SCHEME` - designates the type of database (MySQL, Postgres and SQLite
  are supported).
* `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD` - login credentials to use.
* `SERVER_NAME`, `PORT` - location of the database server
  (typically localhost)
* `DATABASE_NAME` - the name of the ``DEFAULT`` database

For example, a typical MySQL configuration is::

   export DEFAULT_DB_URL=mysql://root@localhost/django

Similarly you can use ``OTHER_DB_URL`` to configure the secondary testing
database. If not set, this defaults to sqlite.

The default is to use an in-memory SQLite database
(``DEFAULT_DB_URL=OTHER_DB_URL=sqlite:///``).

.. _dj-database-url: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dj-database-url

.. _memcached_ci:

Memcached
^^^^^^^^^

In order to run the tests with memcached, make the ``MEMCACHE`` environment
variable available. For the default memcached configuration use::

   export MEMCACHE=127.0.0.1:11211

When all is set, let your server run the following command to run the tests::

   ./tests/runtests.py --settings=test_ci

.. _jenkins:

Jenkins
^^^^^^^

After setting up your Jenkins project and setting up memcache and/or a
database, use a VirtualEnv builder with something similar to the following
lines. This will both install the dependencies and run the tests::

   pip install psycopg2
   pip install dj_database_url
   pip install pytz markdown textile docutils py-bcrypt PyYAML PIL
   pip install -e .
   export DEFAULT_DB_URL=$DBA_POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_URI/django
   ./tests/runtests.py --settings=test_ci

.. NOTE:: This is just a starting point and not meant as a full-fledged
  configuration for your CI environment.

.. _travis:

Travis CI
^^^^^^^^^

`Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_ is a hosted CI service which is free for
Open Source projects. Django comes with a pre-configured ``.travis.yml`` file.
By switching on Travis for your fork of the project on GitHub, any commits you
push will be automatically tested in all supported Python releases and MySQL,
Postgres and SQLite. For using Travis CI, no additional configuration is
required.

.. _contrib-apps:

Contrib apps
------------

Tests for contrib apps go in their respective directories under
``django/contrib``, in a ``tests.py`` file. You can split the tests over
multiple modules by using a ``tests`` directory in the normal Python way.

For the tests to be found, a ``models.py`` file must exist, even if it's empty.
If you have URLs that need to be mapped, put them in ``tests/urls.py``.

To run tests for just one contrib app (e.g. ``auth``), use the same
method as above::

    ./runtests.py --settings=settings auth
