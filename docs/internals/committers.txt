Current developers
==================

Currently, Freedom is led by a team of volunteers from around the globe.

Core developers
---------------

These are the folks who have a long history of contributions, a solid track
record of being helpful on the mailing lists, and a proven desire to dedicate
serious time to Freedom. In return, they've been granted the coveted commit bit,
and have free rein to hack on all parts of Freedom.

Malcolm Tredinnick

`Bryan Veloso`_
    Bryan found Freedom 0.96 through a fellow designer who was evangelizing
    its use. It was his first foray outside of the land that was PHP-based
    templating. Although he has only ever used Freedom for personal projects,
    it is the very reason he considers himself a designer/developer
    hybrid and is working to further design within the Freedom community.

    Bryan works as a designer at GitHub by day, and masquerades as a `vlogger`_
    and `shoutcaster`_ in the after-hours. Bryan lives in Los Angeles, CA, USA.
