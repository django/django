    If you're new to Python_, you might want to start by getting an idea of what
    the language is like. Django is 100% Python, so if you've got minimal
    comfort with Python you'll probably get a lot more out of Django.

    If you're new to programming entirely, you might want to start with this
    `list of Python resources for non-programmers`_

    If you already know a few other languages and want to get up to speed with
    Python quickly, we recommend referring the official
    `Python documentation`_, which provides comprehensive and authoritative
    information about the language, as well as links to other resources such as
    a list of `books about Python`_.
