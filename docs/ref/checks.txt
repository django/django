System check framework
======================

.. currentmodule:: django.core.checks

The system check framework is a set of static checks for validating Django
projects. It detects common problems and provides hints for how to fix them.
The framework is extensible so you can easily add your own checks.

For details on how to add your own checks and integrate them with Django's
system checks, see the :doc:`System check topic guide </topics/checks>`.

API reference
=============

``CheckMessage``
----------------

.. class:: CheckMessage(level, msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)

The warnings and errors raised by system checks must be instances of
``CheckMessage``. An instance encapsulates a single reportable error or
warning. It also provides context and hints applicable to the message, and a
unique identifier that is used for filtering purposes.

Constructor arguments are:

``level``
    The severity of the message. Use one of the predefined values: ``DEBUG``,
    ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, ``CRITICAL``. If the level is greater or
    equal to ``ERROR``, then Django will prevent management commands from
    executing. Messages with level lower than ``ERROR`` (i.e. warnings) are
    reported to the console, but can be silenced.

``msg``
    A short (less than 80 characters) string describing the problem. The string
    should *not* contain newlines.

``hint``
    A single-line string providing a hint for fixing the problem. If no hint
    can be provided, or the hint is self-evident from the error message, the
    hint can be omitted, or a value of ``None`` can be used.

``obj``
    Optional. An object providing context for the message (for example, the
    model where the problem was discovered). The object should be a model,
    field, or manager or any other object that defines a ``__str__()`` method.
    The method is used while reporting all messages and its result precedes the
    message.

``id``
    Optional string. A unique identifier for the issue. Identifiers should
    follow the pattern ``applabel.X001``, where ``X`` is one of the letters
    ``CEWID``, indicating the message severity (``C`` for criticals, ``E`` for
    errors and so). The number can be allocated by the application, but should
    be unique within that application.

There are subclasses to make creating messages with common levels easier. When
using them you can omit the ``level`` argument because it is implied by the
class name.

.. class:: Debug(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Info(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Warning(msg, hint=None obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Error(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Critical(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)

.. _system-check-builtin-tags:

Builtin tags
============

Django's system checks are organized using the following tags:

* ``admin``: Checks of any admin site declarations.
* ``caches``: Checks cache related configuration.
* ``compatibility``: Flags potential problems with version upgrades.
* ``database``: Checks database-related configuration issues. Database checks
  are not run by default because they do more than static code analysis as
  regular checks do. They are only run by the :djadmin:`migrate` command or if
  you specify the ``database`` tag when calling the :djadmin:`check` command.
* ``models``: Checks of model, field, and manager definitions.
* ``security``: Checks security related configuration.
* ``signals``: Checks on signal declarations and handler registrations.
* ``staticfiles``: Checks :mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles` configuration.
* ``templates``: Checks template related configuration.
* ``urls``: Checks URL configuration.

Some checks may be registered with multiple tags.

Core system checks
==================

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

The following checks are performed to warn the user of any potential problems
that might occur as a result of a version upgrade.

* **1_6.W001**: Some project unit tests may not execute as expected. *This
  check was removed in Django 1.8 due to false positives*.
* **1_6.W002**: ``BooleanField`` does not have a default value. *This
  check was removed in Django 1.8 due to false positives*.
* **1_7.W001**:  Django 1.7 changed the global defaults for the
  ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.``
  ``django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware``,
  ``django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware``, and
  ``django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware`` were removed from
  the defaults. If your project needs these middleware then you should
  configure this setting. *This check was removed in Django 1.9*.
* **1_8.W001**: The standalone ``TEMPLATE_*`` settings were deprecated in
  Django 1.8 and the :setting:`TEMPLATES` dictionary takes precedence. You must
  put the values of the following settings into your defaults ``TEMPLATES``
  dict: ``TEMPLATE_DIRS``, ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``, ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG``,
  ``TEMPLATE_LOADERS``, ``TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID``. *This check was removed
  in Django 2.0*.
* **1_10.W001**: The ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` setting is deprecated in Django
  1.10  and the :setting:`MIDDLEWARE` setting takes precedence. Since you've
  set ``MIDDLEWARE``, the value of ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` is ignored. *This
  check was removed in Django 2.0*.

Caches
------

The following checks verify that your :setting:`CACHES` setting is correctly
configured:

* **caches.E001**: You must define a ``'default'`` cache in your
  :setting:`CACHES` setting.

Database
--------

MySQL
~~~~~

If you're using MySQL, the following checks will be performed:

* **mysql.E001**: MySQL does not allow unique ``CharField``\s to have a
  ``max_length`` > 255.
* **mysql.W002**: MySQL Strict Mode is not set for database connection
  '<alias>'. See also :ref:`mysql-sql-mode`.

* **fields.E121**: ``max_length`` must be a positive integer.
* **fields.W122**: ``max_length`` is ignored when used with ``IntegerField``.
* **fields.E130**: ``DecimalField``\s must define a ``decimal_places`` attribute.
* **fields.E131**: ``decimal_places`` must be a non-negative integer.
* **fields.E132**: ``DecimalField``\s must define a ``max_digits`` attribute.
* **fields.E133**: ``max_digits`` must be a non-negative integer.
* **fields.E134**: ``max_digits`` must be greater or equal to ``decimal_places``.
* **fields.E140**: ``FilePathField``\s must have either ``allow_files`` or
  ``allow_folders`` set to True.
* **fields.E150**: ``GenericIPAddressField``\s cannot accept blank values if
  null values are not allowed, as blank values are stored as nulls.
* **fields.E160**: The options ``auto_now``, ``auto_now_add``, and ``default``
  are mutually exclusive. Only one of these options may be present.
* **fields.W161**: Fixed default value provided.
* **fields.W162**: ``<database>`` does not support a database index on
  ``<field data type>`` columns.
* **fields.E900**: ``IPAddressField`` has been removed except for support in
  historical migrations.
* **fields.W900**: ``IPAddressField`` has been deprecated. Support for it
  (except in historical migrations) will be removed in Django 1.9. *This check
  appeared in Django 1.7 and 1.8*.
* **fields.W901**: ``CommaSeparatedIntegerField`` has been deprecated. Support
  for it (except in historical migrations) will be removed in Django 2.0. *This
  check appeared in Django 1.10 and 1.11*.

  ``'__'``.
* **fields.E310**: No subset of the fields ``<field1>``, ``<field2>``, ... on
  model ``<model>`` is unique. Add ``unique=True`` on any of those fields or
  add at least a subset of them to a unique_together constraint.
* **fields.E311**: ``<model>`` must set ``unique=True`` because it is
  referenced by a ``ForeignKey``.
* **fields.E312**: The ``to_field`` ``<field name>`` doesn't exist on the
  related model ``<app label>.<model>``.
* **fields.E320**: Field specifies ``on_delete=SET_NULL``, but cannot be null.

  but it has more than two foreign keys to ``<model>``, which is ambiguous.
  You must specify which two foreign keys Django should use via the
  ``through_fields`` keyword argument.
* **fields.E334**: The model is used as an intermediate model by ``<model>``,
  but it has more than one foreign key from ``<model>``, which is ambiguous.
  You must specify which foreign key Django should use via the

* **fields.W342**: Setting ``unique=True`` on a ``ForeignKey`` has the same
  effect as using a ``OneToOneField``.
* **fields.W343**: ``limit_choices_to`` has no effect on ``ManyToManyField``
  with a ``through`` model.

Models
------

* **models.E001**: ``<swappable>`` is not of the form ``app_label.app_name``.
* **models.E002**: ``<SETTING>`` references ``<model>``, which has not been
  installed, or is abstract.
* **models.E003**: The model has two many-to-many relations through the
  intermediate model ``<app_label>.<model>``.
* **models.E004**: ``id`` can only be used as a field name if the field also
  sets ``primary_key=True``.

Security
--------

The security checks do not make your site secure. They do not audit code, do
intrusion detection, or do anything particularly complex. Rather, they help
perform an automated, low-hanging-fruit checklist. They help you remember the
simple things that improve your site's security.

Some of these checks may not be appropriate for your particular deployment
configuration. For instance, if you do your HTTP to HTTPS redirection in a load
balancer, it'd be irritating to be constantly warned about not having enabled
:setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`. Use :setting:`SILENCED_SYSTEM_CHECKS` to
silence unneeded checks.

The following checks are run if you use the :option:`check --deploy` option:

* **security.W001**: You do not have
  :class:`django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE` so the :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`,
  :setting:`SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`, :setting:`SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`,
  and :setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` settings will have no effect.
* **security.W002**: You do not have
  :class:`django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, so your pages will not be served with an
  ``'x-frame-options'`` header. Unless there is a good reason for your
  site to be served in a frame, you should consider enabling this
  header to help prevent clickjacking attacks.
* **security.W003**: You don't appear to be using Django's built-in cross-site
  request forgery protection via the middleware
  (:class:`django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` is not in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`). Enabling the middleware is the safest
  approach to ensure you don't leave any holes.
* **security.W004**: You have not set a value for the
  :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` setting. If your entire site is served only
  over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling :ref:`HTTP
  Strict Transport Security <http-strict-transport-security>`. Be sure to read
  the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious,
  irreversible problems.
* **security.W005**: You have not set the
  :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS` setting to ``True``. Without this,
  your site is potentially vulnerable to attack via an insecure connection to a
  subdomain. Only set this to ``True`` if you are certain that all subdomains of
  your domain should be served exclusively via SSL.
* **security.W006**: Your :setting:`SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` setting is not
  set to ``True``, so your pages will not be served with an
  ``'x-content-type-options: nosniff'`` header. You should consider enabling
  this header to prevent the browser from identifying content types incorrectly.
* **security.W007**: Your :setting:`SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` setting is not
  set to ``True``, so your pages will not be served with an
  ``'x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block'`` header. You should consider enabling
  this header to activate the browser's XSS filtering and help prevent XSS
  attacks.
* **security.W008**: Your :setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` setting is not set to
  ``True``. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL
  connections, you may want to either set this setting to ``True`` or configure
  a load balancer or reverse-proxy server  to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
* **security.W009**: Your :setting:`SECRET_KEY` has less than 50 characters or
  less than 5 unique characters. Please generate a long and random
  ``SECRET_KEY``, otherwise many of Django's security-critical features will be
  vulnerable to attack.
* **security.W010**: You have :mod:`django.contrib.sessions` in your
  :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` but you have not set
  :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` to ``True``. Using a secure-only session
  cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to hijack user
  sessions.
* **security.W011**: You have
  :class:`django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, but you have not set :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`
  to ``True``. Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for
  network traffic sniffers to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W012**: :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is not set to ``True``.
  Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic
  sniffers to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W013**: You have :mod:`django.contrib.sessions` in your
  :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, but you have not set
  :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` to ``True``. Using an ``HttpOnly`` session
  cookie makes it more difficult for cross-site scripting attacks to hijack user
  sessions.
* **security.W014**: You have
  :class:`django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, but you have not set :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`
  to ``True``. Using an ``HttpOnly`` session cookie makes it more difficult for
  cross-site scripting attacks to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W015**: :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` is not set to ``True``.
  Using an ``HttpOnly`` session cookie makes it more difficult for cross-site
  scripting attacks to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W016**: :setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` is not set to ``True``.
  Using a secure-only CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic
  sniffers to steal the CSRF token.
* **security.W017**: :setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` is not set to ``True``.
  Using an ``HttpOnly`` CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for cross-site
  scripting attacks to steal the CSRF token. *This check is removed in Django
  1.11 as the* :setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` *setting offers no pratical
  benefit.*
* **security.W018**: You should not have :setting:`DEBUG` set to ``True`` in
  deployment.
* **security.W019**: You have
  :class:`django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, but :setting:`X_FRAME_OPTIONS` is not set to
  ``'DENY'``. The default is ``'SAMEORIGIN'``, but unless there is a good reason
  for your site to serve other parts of itself in a frame, you should change
  it to ``'DENY'``.
* **security.W020**: :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` must not be empty in deployment.
* **security.W021**: You have not set the
  :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD` setting to ``True``. Without this, your site
  cannot be submitted to the browser preload list.

Signals
-------

* **signals.E001**: ``<handler>`` was connected to the ``<signal>`` signal with
  a lazy reference to the sender ``<app label>.<model>``, but app ``<app label>``
  isn't installed or doesn't provide model ``<model>``.

Templates
---------

The following checks verify that your :setting:`TEMPLATES` setting is correctly
configured:

* **templates.E001**: You have ``'APP_DIRS': True`` in your
  :setting:`TEMPLATES` but also specify ``'loaders'`` in ``OPTIONS``. Either
  remove ``APP_DIRS`` or remove the ``'loaders'`` option.
* **templates.E002**: ``string_if_invalid`` in :setting:`TEMPLATES`
  :setting:`OPTIONS <TEMPLATES-OPTIONS>` must be a string but got: ``{value}``
  (``{type}``).

URLs
----

The following checks are performed on your URL configuration:

* **urls.W001**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` uses
  :func:`~django.urls.include` with a ``route`` ending with a ``$``. Remove the
  dollar from the ``route`` to avoid problems including URLs.
* **urls.W002**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` has a ``route`` beginning with
  a ``/``. Remove this slash as it is unnecessary. If this pattern is targeted
  in an :func:`~django.urls.include`, ensure the :func:`~django.urls.include`
  pattern has a trailing ``/``.
* **urls.W003**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` has a ``name``
  including a ``:``. Remove the colon, to avoid ambiguous namespace
  references.
* **urls.E004**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` is invalid. Ensure that
  ``urlpatterns`` is a list of :func:`~django.urls.path` and/or
  :func:`~django.urls.re_path` instances.
* **urls.W005**: URL namespace ``<namespace>`` isn't unique. You may not be
  able to reverse all URLs in this namespace.
* **urls.E006**: The :setting:`MEDIA_URL`/ :setting:`STATIC_URL` setting must
  end with a slash.

``contrib`` app checks
======================

``admin``
---------

Admin checks are all performed as part of the ``admin`` tag.

The following checks are performed on any
:class:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin` (or subclass) that is registered
with the admin site:

* **admin.E001**: The value of ``raw_id_fields`` must be a list or tuple.
* **admin.E002**: The value of ``raw_id_fields[n]`` refers to ``<field name>``,
  which is not an attribute of ``<model>``.
