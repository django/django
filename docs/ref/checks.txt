======================
System check framework
======================

.. currentmodule:: django.core.checks

The system check framework is a set of static checks for validating Django
projects. It detects common problems and provides hints for how to fix them.
The framework is extensible so you can easily add your own checks.

For details on how to add your own checks and integrate them with Django's
system checks, see the :doc:`System check topic guide </topics/checks>`.

API reference
=============

``CheckMessage``
----------------

.. class:: CheckMessage(level, msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)

The warnings and errors raised by system checks must be instances of
``CheckMessage``. An instance encapsulates a single reportable error or
warning. It also provides context and hints applicable to the message, and a
unique identifier that is used for filtering purposes.

Constructor arguments are:

``level``
    The severity of the message. Use one of the predefined values: ``DEBUG``,
    ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, ``CRITICAL``. If the level is greater or
    equal to ``ERROR``, then Django will prevent management commands from
    executing. Messages with level lower than ``ERROR`` (i.e. warnings) are
    reported to the console, but can be silenced.

``msg``
    A short (less than 80 characters) string describing the problem. The string
    should *not* contain newlines.

``hint``
    A single-line string providing a hint for fixing the problem. If no hint
    can be provided, or the hint is self-evident from the error message, the
    hint can be omitted, or a value of ``None`` can be used.

``obj``
    Optional. An object providing context for the message (for example, the
    model where the problem was discovered). The object should be a model,
    field, or manager or any other object that defines a ``__str__()`` method.
    The method is used while reporting all messages and its result precedes the
    message.

``id``
    Optional string. A unique identifier for the issue. Identifiers should
    follow the pattern ``applabel.X001``, where ``X`` is one of the letters
    ``CEWID``, indicating the message severity (``C`` for criticals, ``E`` for
    errors and so). The number can be allocated by the application, but should
    be unique within that application.

There are subclasses to make creating messages with common levels easier. When
using them you can omit the ``level`` argument because it is implied by the
class name.

.. class:: Debug(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Info(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Warning(msg, hint=None obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Error(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)
.. class:: Critical(msg, hint=None, obj=None, id=None)

.. _system-check-builtin-tags:

Builtin tags
============

Django's system checks are organized using the following tags:

* ``admin``: Checks of any admin site declarations.
* ``async_support``: Checks asynchronous-related configuration.
* ``caches``: Checks cache related configuration.
* ``compatibility``: Flags potential problems with version upgrades.
* ``commands``: Checks custom management commands related configuration.
* ``database``: Checks database-related configuration issues. Database checks
  are not run by default because they do more than static code analysis as
  regular checks do. They are only run by the :djadmin:`migrate` command or if
  you specify configured database aliases using the ``--database`` option when
  calling the :djadmin:`check` command.
* ``files``: Checks files related configuration.
* ``models``: Checks of model, field, and manager definitions.
* ``security``: Checks security related configuration.
* ``signals``: Checks on signal declarations and handler registrations.
* ``sites``: Checks :mod:`django.contrib.sites` configuration.
* ``staticfiles``: Checks :mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles` configuration.
* ``templates``: Checks template related configuration.
* ``translation``: Checks translation related configuration.
* ``urls``: Checks URL configuration.

Some checks may be registered with multiple tags.

Core system checks
==================

Asynchronous support
--------------------

The following checks verify your setup for :doc:`/topics/async`:

* **async.E001**: You should not set the :envvar:`DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE`
  environment variable in deployment. This disables :ref:`async safety
  protection <async-safety>`.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

Compatibility checks warn of potential problems that might occur after
upgrading Django.

* **2_0.W001**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` has a ``route`` that contains
  ``(?P<``, begins with a ``^``, or ends with a ``$``. This was likely an
  oversight when migrating from ``url()`` to :func:`~django.urls.path`.
* **4_0.E001**: As of Django 4.0, the values in the
  :setting:`CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` setting must start with a scheme (usually
  ``http://`` or ``https://``) but found ``<hostname>``.

Caches
------

The following checks verify that your :setting:`CACHES` setting is correctly
configured:

* **caches.E001**: You must define a ``'default'`` cache in your
  :setting:`CACHES` setting.
* **caches.W002**: Your ``<cache>`` configuration might expose your cache or
  lead to corruption of your data because its
  :setting:`LOCATION <CACHES-LOCATION>` matches/is inside/contains
  :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT`/:setting:`STATIC_ROOT`/:setting:`STATICFILES_DIRS`.
* **caches.W003**: Your ``<cache>`` cache :setting:`LOCATION <CACHES-LOCATION>`
  is relative. Use an absolute path instead.

Database
--------

MySQL and MariaDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using MySQL or MariaDB, the following checks will be performed:

* **mysql.E001**: MySQL/MariaDB does not allow unique ``CharField``\s to have a
  ``max_length`` > 255. *This check was changed to* ``mysql.W003`` *in Django
  3.1 as the real maximum size depends on many factors.*
* **mysql.W002**: MySQL/MariaDB Strict Mode is not set for database connection
  ``<alias>``. See also :ref:`mysql-sql-mode`.
* **mysql.W003**: MySQL/MariaDB may not allow unique ``CharField``\s to have a
  ``max_length`` > 255.

Managing files
--------------

The following checks verify your setup for :doc:`/topics/files`:

* **files.E001**: The :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR` setting refers to the
  nonexistent directory ``<path>``.

Model fields
------------

* **fields.E001**: Field names must not end with an underscore.
* **fields.E002**: Field names must not contain ``"__"``.
* **fields.E003**: ``pk`` is a reserved word that cannot be used as a field
  name.
* **fields.E004**: ``choices`` must be a mapping (e.g. a dictionary) or an
  iterable (e.g. a list or tuple).
* **fields.E005**: ``choices`` must be a mapping of actual values to human
  readable names or an iterable containing ``(actual value, human readable
  name)`` tuples.
* **fields.E006**: ``db_index`` must be ``None``, ``True`` or ``False``.
* **fields.E007**: Primary keys must not have ``null=True``.
* **fields.E008**: All ``validators`` must be callable.
* **fields.E009**: ``max_length`` is too small to fit the longest value in
  ``choices`` (``<count>`` characters).
* **fields.E010**: ``<field>`` default should be a callable instead of an
  instance so that it's not shared between all field instances.
* **fields.E011**: ``<database>`` does not support default database values with
  expressions (``db_default``).
* **fields.E012**: ``<expression>`` cannot be used in ``db_default``.
* **fields.E013**: ``CompositePrimaryKey`` must be named ``pk``.
* **fields.E100**: ``AutoField``\s must set primary_key=True.
* **fields.E110**: ``BooleanField``\s do not accept null values. *This check
  appeared before support for null values was added in Django 2.1.*
* **fields.E120**: ``CharField``\s must define a ``max_length`` attribute.
* **fields.E121**: ``max_length`` must be a positive integer.
* **fields.W122**: ``max_length`` is ignored when used with
  ``<integer field type>``.
* **fields.E130**: ``DecimalField``\s must define a ``decimal_places`` attribute.
* **fields.E131**: ``decimal_places`` must be a non-negative integer.

* **fields.E133**: ``max_digits`` must be a positive integer.
* **fields.E134**: ``max_digits`` must be greater or equal to ``decimal_places``.
* **fields.E140**: ``FilePathField``\s must have either ``allow_files`` or
  ``allow_folders`` set to True.
* **fields.E150**: ``GenericIPAddressField``\s cannot have ``blank=True`` if
  ``null=False``, as blank values are stored as nulls.
* **fields.E160**: The options ``auto_now``, ``auto_now_add``, and ``default``
  are mutually exclusive. Only one of these options may be present.
* **fields.W161**: Fixed default value provided.

Management Commands
-------------------

The following checks verify custom management commands are correctly configured:

* **commands.E001**: The ``migrate`` and ``makemigrations`` commands must have
  the same ``autodetector``.

Security
--------

The security checks do not make your site secure. They do not audit code, do
intrusion detection, or do anything particularly complex. Rather, they help
perform an automated, low-hanging-fruit checklist, that can help you to improve
your site's security.

Some of these checks may not be appropriate for your particular deployment
configuration. For instance, if you do your HTTP to HTTPS redirection in a load
balancer, it'd be irritating to be constantly warned about not having enabled
:setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`. Use :setting:`SILENCED_SYSTEM_CHECKS` to
silence unneeded checks.

The following checks are run if you use the :option:`check --deploy` option:

* **security.W001**: You do not have
  :class:`django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE` so the :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`,
  :setting:`SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`, :setting:`SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY`,
  :setting:`SECURE_CROSS_ORIGIN_OPENER_POLICY`, and
  :setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` settings will have no effect.
* **security.W002**: You do not have
  :class:`django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, so your pages will not be served with an
  ``'x-frame-options'`` header. Unless there is a good reason for your
  site to be served in a frame, you should consider enabling this
  header to help prevent clickjacking attacks.
* **security.W003**: You don't appear to be using Django's built-in cross-site
  request forgery protection via the middleware
  (:class:`django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` is not in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`). Enabling the middleware is the safest
  approach to ensure you don't leave any holes.
* **security.W004**: You have not set a value for the
  :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` setting. If your entire site is served only
  over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling :ref:`HTTP
  Strict Transport Security <http-strict-transport-security>`. Be sure to read
  the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious,
  irreversible problems.
* **security.W005**: You have not set the
  :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS` setting to ``True``. Without this,
  your site is potentially vulnerable to attack via an insecure connection to a
  subdomain. Only set this to ``True`` if you are certain that all subdomains of
  your domain should be served exclusively via SSL.
* **security.W006**: Your :setting:`SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` setting is not
  set to ``True``, so your pages will not be served with an
  ``'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff'`` header. You should consider enabling
  this header to prevent the browser from identifying content types incorrectly.
* **security.W007**: Your ``SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`` setting is not
  set to ``True``, so your pages will not be served with an
  ``'X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block'`` header. You should consider enabling
  this header to activate the browser's XSS filtering and help prevent XSS
  attacks. *This check is removed in Django 3.0 as the* ``X-XSS-Protection``
  *header is no longer honored by modern browsers.*
* **security.W008**: Your :setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` setting is not set to
  ``True``. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL
  connections, you may want to either set this setting to ``True`` or configure
  a load balancer or reverse-proxy server  to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
* **security.W009**: Your :setting:`SECRET_KEY` has less than 50 characters,
  less than 5 unique characters, or it's prefixed with ``'django-insecure-'``
  indicating that it was generated automatically by Django. Please generate a
  long and random value, otherwise many of Django's security-critical features
  will be vulnerable to attack.
* **security.W010**: You have :mod:`django.contrib.sessions` in your
  :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` but you have not set
  :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` to ``True``. Using a secure-only session
  cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to hijack user
  sessions.
* **security.W011**: You have
  :class:`django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, but you have not set :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`
  to ``True``. Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for
  network traffic sniffers to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W012**: :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is not set to ``True``.
  Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic
  sniffers to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W013**: You have :mod:`django.contrib.sessions` in your
  :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, but you have not set
  :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` to ``True``. Using an ``HttpOnly`` session
  cookie makes it more difficult for cross-site scripting attacks to hijack user
  sessions.
* **security.W014**: You have
  :class:`django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, but you have not set :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`
  to ``True``. Using an ``HttpOnly`` session cookie makes it more difficult for
  cross-site scripting attacks to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W015**: :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` is not set to ``True``.
  Using an ``HttpOnly`` session cookie makes it more difficult for cross-site
  scripting attacks to hijack user sessions.
* **security.W016**: :setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` is not set to ``True``.
  Using a secure-only CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic
  sniffers to steal the CSRF token.
* **security.W017**: :setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` is not set to ``True``.
  Using an ``HttpOnly`` CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for cross-site
  scripting attacks to steal the CSRF token. *This check is removed in Django
  1.11 as the* :setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` *setting offers no practical
  benefit.*
* **security.W018**: You should not have :setting:`DEBUG` set to ``True`` in
  deployment.
* **security.W019**: You have
  :class:`django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware` in your
  :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`, but :setting:`X_FRAME_OPTIONS` is not set to
  ``'DENY'``. Unless there is a good reason for your site to serve other parts
  of itself in a frame, you should change it to ``'DENY'``.
* **security.W020**: :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` must not be empty in deployment.
* **security.W021**: You have not set the
  :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD` setting to ``True``. Without this, your site
  cannot be submitted to the browser preload list.
* **security.W022**: You have not set the :setting:`SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY`
  setting. Without this, your site will not send a Referrer-Policy header. You
  should consider enabling this header to protect user privacy.
* **security.E023**: You have set the :setting:`SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY` setting
  to an invalid value.
* **security.E024**: You have set the
  :setting:`SECURE_CROSS_ORIGIN_OPENER_POLICY` setting to an invalid value.
* **security.W025**: Your
  :setting:`SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS[n] <SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS>` has less than 50
  characters, less than 5 unique characters, or it's prefixed with
  ``'django-insecure-'`` indicating that it was generated automatically by
  Django. Please generate a long and random value, otherwise many of Django's
  security-critical features will be vulnerable to attack.

The following checks verify that your security-related settings are correctly
configured:

* **security.E100**: ``DEFAULT_HASHING_ALGORITHM`` must be ``'sha1'`` or
  ``'sha256'``. *This check appeared in Django 3.1 and 3.2*.
* **security.E101**: The CSRF failure view ``'path.to.view'`` does not take the
  correct number of arguments.
* **security.E102**: The CSRF failure view ``'path.to.view'`` could not be
  imported.

Signals
-------

* **signals.E001**: ``<handler>`` was connected to the ``<signal>`` signal with
  a lazy reference to the sender ``<app label>.<model>``, but app ``<app label>``
  isn't installed or doesn't provide model ``<model>``.

Templates
---------

The following checks verify that your :setting:`TEMPLATES` setting is correctly
configured:

* **templates.E001**: You have ``'APP_DIRS': True`` in your
  :setting:`TEMPLATES` but also specify ``'loaders'`` in ``OPTIONS``. Either
  remove ``APP_DIRS`` or remove the ``'loaders'`` option. *This check is
  removed in Django 5.1 as system checks may now raise*
  ``ImproperlyConfigured`` *instead.*
* **templates.E002**: ``string_if_invalid`` in :setting:`TEMPLATES`
  :setting:`OPTIONS <TEMPLATES-OPTIONS>` must be a string but got: ``{value}``
  (``{type}``).
* **templates.E003**:``<name>`` is used for multiple template tag modules:
  ``<module list>``. *This check was changed to* ``templates.W003`` *in Django
  4.1.2*.
* **templates.W003**:``<name>`` is used for multiple template tag modules:
  ``<module list>``.

Translation
-----------

The following checks are performed on your translation configuration:

* **translation.E001**: You have provided an invalid value for the
  :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE` setting: ``<value>``.
* **translation.E002**: You have provided an invalid language code in the
  :setting:`LANGUAGES` setting: ``<value>``.
* **translation.E003**: You have provided an invalid language code in the
  :setting:`LANGUAGES_BIDI` setting: ``<value>``.
* **translation.E004**: You have provided a value for the
  :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE` setting that is not in the :setting:`LANGUAGES`
  setting.

URLs
----

The following checks are performed on your URL configuration:

* **urls.W001**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` uses
  :func:`~django.urls.include` with a ``route`` ending with a ``$``. Remove the
  dollar from the ``route`` to avoid problems including URLs.
* **urls.W002**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` has a ``route`` beginning with
  a ``/``. Remove this slash as it is unnecessary. If this pattern is targeted
  in an :func:`~django.urls.include`, ensure the :func:`~django.urls.include`
  pattern has a trailing ``/``.
* **urls.W003**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` has a ``name``
  including a ``:``. Remove the colon, to avoid ambiguous namespace
  references.
* **urls.E004**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` is invalid. Ensure that
  ``urlpatterns`` is a list of :func:`~django.urls.path` and/or
  :func:`~django.urls.re_path` instances.
* **urls.W005**: URL namespace ``<namespace>`` isn't unique. You may not be
  able to reverse all URLs in this namespace.
* **urls.E006**: The :setting:`MEDIA_URL`/ :setting:`STATIC_URL` setting must

  ``<view>.as_view()`` instead of ``<view>``.
* **urls.W010**: Your URL pattern ``<pattern>`` has an unmatched
  ``<angle bracket>``.
