Date-based mixins
=================

.. currentmodule:: django.views.generic.dates

.. note::

    All the date formatting attributes in these mixins use
    :func:`~time.strftime` format characters. Do not try to use the format
    characters from the :ttag:`now` template tag as they are not compatible.

``DateMixin``
=============

.. class:: DateMixin

    A mixin class providing common behavior for all date-based views.

    **Methods and Attributes**

    .. attribute:: date_field

        The name of the ``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` in the
        ``QuerySet``’s model that the date-based archive should use to
        determine the list of objects to display on the page.

        When :doc:`time zone support </topics/i18n/timezones>` is enabled and
        ``date_field`` is a ``DateTimeField``, dates are assumed to be in the
        current time zone. Otherwise, the queryset could include objects from
        the previous or the next day in the end user's time zone.

        .. warning::

            In this situation, if you have implemented per-user time zone
            selection, the same URL may show a different set of objects,
            depending on the end user's time zone. To avoid this, you should
            use a ``DateField`` as the ``date_field`` attribute.

    .. attribute:: allow_future

        A boolean specifying whether to include "future" objects on this page,
        where "future" means objects in which the field specified in
        ``date_field`` is greater than the current date/time. By default, this
        is ``False``.

    .. method:: get_date_field()

        Returns the name of the field that contains the date data that this
        view will operate on. Returns :attr:`~DateMixin.date_field` by default.

    .. method:: get_allow_future()

        Determine whether to include "future" objects on this page, where
        "future" means objects in which the field specified in ``date_field``
        is greater than the current date/time. Returns
        :attr:`~DateMixin.allow_future` by default.

``BaseDateListView``
====================

.. class:: BaseDateListView

    A base class that provides common behavior for all date-based views. There
    won't normally be a reason to instantiate
    :class:`~django.views.generic.dates.BaseDateListView`; instantiate one of
    the subclasses instead.

    While this view (and its subclasses) are executing, ``self.object_list``
    will contain the list of objects that the view is operating upon, and
    ``self.date_list`` will contain the list of dates for which data is
    available.

    **Mixins**

    * :class:`~django.views.generic.dates.DateMixin`
    * :class:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin`

    **Methods and Attributes**

    .. attribute:: allow_empty

        A boolean specifying whether to display the page if no objects are
        available. If this is ``True`` and no objects are available, the view
        will display an empty page instead of raising a 404.

        This is identical to
        :attr:`django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.allow_empty`,
        except for the default value, which is ``False``.

    .. attribute:: date_list_period

        **Optional** A string defining the aggregation period for
        ``date_list``. It must be one of ``'year'`` (default), ``'month'``, or
        ``'day'``.

    .. method:: get_dated_items()

        Returns a 3-tuple containing (``date_list``, ``object_list``,
        ``extra_context``).

        ``date_list`` is the list of dates for which data is available.
        ``object_list`` is the list of objects. ``extra_context`` is a
        dictionary of context data that will be added to any context data
        provided by the
        :class:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin`.

    .. method:: get_dated_queryset(**lookup)

        Returns a queryset, filtered using the query arguments defined by
        ``lookup``. Enforces any restrictions on the queryset, such as
        ``allow_empty`` and ``allow_future``.

    .. method:: get_date_list_period()

        Returns the aggregation period for ``date_list``. Returns
        :attr:`~BaseDateListView.date_list_period` by default.

    .. method:: get_date_list(queryset, date_type=None, ordering='ASC')

        Returns the list of dates of type ``date_type`` for which ``queryset``
        contains entries. For example, ``get_date_list(qs, 'year')`` will
        return the list of years for which ``qs`` has entries. If
        ``date_type`` isn't provided, the result of
        :meth:`~BaseDateListView.get_date_list_period` is used. ``date_type``
        and ``ordering`` are passed to
        :meth:`QuerySet.dates()<django.db.models.query.QuerySet.dates>`.
