``ModelAdmin`` List Filters
===========================

.. currentmodule:: django.contrib.admin

``ModelAdmin`` classes can define list filters that appear in the right sidebar
of the change list page of the admin, as illustrated in the following
screenshot:

.. image:: _images/list_filter.png

To activate per-field filtering, set :attr:`ModelAdmin.list_filter` to a list
or tuple of elements, where each element is one of the following types:

- A field name.
- A subclass of ``django.contrib.admin.SimpleListFilter``.
- A 2-tuple containing a field name and a subclass of
  ``django.contrib.admin.FieldListFilter``.

See the examples below for discussion of each of these options for defining
``list_filter``.

Using a field name
==================

The simplest option is to specify the required field names from your model.

Each specified field should be either a ``BooleanField``, ``CharField``,
``DateField``, ``DateTimeField``, ``IntegerField``, ``ForeignKey`` or
``ManyToManyField``, for example::

    class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = ["is_staff", "company"]

Field names in ``list_filter`` can also span relations
using the ``__`` lookup, for example::

    class PersonAdmin(admin.UserAdmin):
        list_filter = ["company__name"]

Using a ``SimpleListFilter``
============================

For custom filtering, you can define your own list filter by subclassing
``django.contrib.admin.SimpleListFilter``. You need to provide the ``title``
and ``parameter_name`` attributes, and override the ``lookups`` and
``queryset`` methods, e.g.::

    from datetime import date

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _


    class DecadeBornListFilter(admin.SimpleListFilter):
        # Human-readable title which will be displayed in the
        # right admin sidebar just above the filter options.
        title = _("decade born")

        # Parameter for the filter that will be used in the URL query.
        parameter_name = "decade"

        def lookups(self, request, model_admin):
            """
            Returns a list of tuples. The first element in each
            tuple is the coded value for the option that will
            appear in the URL query. The second element is the
            human-readable name for the option that will appear
            in the right sidebar.
            """
            return [
                ("80s", _("in the eighties")),
                ("90s", _("in the nineties")),
            ]

        def queryset(self, request, queryset):
            """
            Returns the filtered queryset based on the value
            provided in the query string and retrievable via
            `self.value()`.
            """
            # Compare the requested value (either '80s' or '90s')
            # to decide how to filter the queryset.
            if self.value() == "80s":
                return queryset.filter(
                    birthday__gte=date(1980, 1, 1),
                    birthday__lte=date(1989, 12, 31),
                )
            if self.value() == "90s":
                return queryset.filter(
                    birthday__gte=date(1990, 1, 1),
                    birthday__lte=date(1999, 12, 31),
                )


    class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = [DecadeBornListFilter]

.. note::

    As a convenience, the ``HttpRequest`` object is passed to the ``lookups``
    and ``queryset`` methods, for example::

        class AuthDecadeBornListFilter(DecadeBornListFilter):
            def lookups(self, request, model_admin):
                if request.user.is_superuser:
                    return super().lookups(request, model_admin)

            def queryset(self, request, queryset):
                if request.user.is_superuser:
                    return super().queryset(request, queryset)

    Also as a convenience, the ``ModelAdmin`` object is passed to the
    ``lookups`` method, for example if you want to base the lookups on the
    available data::

        class AdvancedDecadeBornListFilter(DecadeBornListFilter):
            def lookups(self, request, model_admin):
                """
                Only show the lookups if there actually is
                anyone born in the corresponding decades.
                """
                qs = model_admin.get_queryset(request)
                if qs.filter(
                    birthday__gte=date(1980, 1, 1),
                    birthday__lte=date(1989, 12, 31),
                ).exists():
                    yield ("80s", _("in the eighties"))
                if qs.filter(
                    birthday__gte=date(1990, 1, 1),
                    birthday__lte=date(1999, 12, 31),
                ).exists():
                    yield ("90s", _("in the nineties"))

Using a field name and an explicit ``FieldListFilter``
======================================================

Finally, if you wish to specify an explicit filter type to use with a field you
may provide a ``list_filter`` item as a 2-tuple, where the first element is a
field name and the second element is a class inheriting from
``django.contrib.admin.FieldListFilter``, for example::

    class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = [
            ("is_staff", admin.BooleanFieldListFilter),
        ]

Here the ``is_staff`` field will use the ``BooleanFieldListFilter``. Specifying
only the field name, fields will automatically use the appropriate filter for
most cases, but this format allows you to control the filter used.

The following examples show available filter classes that you need to opt-in
to use.

You can limit the choices of a related model to the objects involved in
that relation using ``RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter``::

    class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = [
            ("author", admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter),
        ]

Assuming ``author`` is a ``ForeignKey`` to a ``User`` model, this will
limit the ``list_filter`` choices to the users who have written a book,
instead of listing all users.

You can filter empty values using ``EmptyFieldListFilter``, which can
filter on both empty strings and nulls, depending on what the field
allows to store::

    class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = [
            ("title", admin.EmptyFieldListFilter),
        ]

By defining a filter using the ``__in`` lookup, it is possible to filter for
any of a group of values. You need to override the ``expected_parameters``
method, and the specify the ``lookup_kwargs`` attribute with the appropriate
field name. By default, multiple values in the query string will be separated
with commas, but this can be customized via the ``list_separator`` attribute.
The following example shows such a filter using the vertical-pipe character as
the separator::

    class FilterWithCustomSeparator(admin.FieldListFilter):
        # custom list separator that should be used to separate values.
        list_separator = "|"

        def __init__(self, field, request, params, model, model_admin, field_path):
            self.lookup_kwarg = "%s__in" % field_path
            super().__init__(field, request, params, model, model_admin, field_path)

        def expected_parameters(self):
            return [self.lookup_kwarg]

.. note::

    The :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey` field is
    not supported.

List filters typically appear only if the filter has more than one choice. A
filter's ``has_output()`` method controls whether or not it appears.

It is possible to specify a custom template for rendering a list filter::

    class FilterWithCustomTemplate(admin.SimpleListFilter):
        template = "custom_template.html"

See the default template provided by Django (``admin/filter.html``) for a
concrete example.

.. _facet-filters:

Facets
======

By default, counts for each filter, known as facets, can be shown by toggling
on via the admin UI. These counts will update according to the currently
applied filters. See :attr:`ModelAdmin.show_facets` for more details.
