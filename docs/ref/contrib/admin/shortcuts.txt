Django Admin Keyboard Shortcuts
===============================

.. versionadded:: 5.1

The Django admin interface includes keyboard shortcuts for common form actions, 
allowing you to save time when working with admin forms.

Available Shortcuts
===================

The following keyboard shortcuts are available on admin change and add forms:

.. list-table:: Admin Form Shortcuts
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 20 50

   * - Action
     - Mac
     - Windows/Linux
   * - Save and continue editing
     - Command + S
     - Ctrl + S
   * - Save and exit
     - Command + Shift + S
     - Ctrl + Shift + S
   * - Save and add another
     - Command + Alt + S
     - Ctrl + Alt + S

How It Works
============

Keyboard shortcuts are automatically enabled on all admin forms that contain
the corresponding action buttons. The shortcuts will only work when:

* The corresponding button is present and visible on the form
* The button is not disabled
* You are not currently focused on an input field (to prevent conflicts)

Visual Hints
============

When you hover over form action buttons, you'll see tooltip hints showing
the available keyboard shortcuts for that button.

Browser Compatibility
=====================

Keyboard shortcuts work in all modern browsers including:

* Chrome 60+
* Firefox 60+
* Safari 12+
* Edge 79+

Accessibility
=============

The keyboard shortcuts feature is designed with accessibility in mind:

* Shortcuts don't interfere with screen reader navigation
* Visual hints are provided via standard ``title`` attributes
* Shortcuts are disabled when focused on editable elements
* All functionality remains available via mouse/touch interaction

Technical Implementation
========================

The shortcuts are implemented using vanilla JavaScript without external
dependencies. The feature uses progressive enhancement, meaning forms will
work normally even if JavaScript is disabled.

The shortcuts module is only loaded on admin change and add forms, not on
other admin pages, to minimize performance impact.

Customization
=============

If you need to disable keyboard shortcuts in your custom admin forms, you can
override the ``admin_change_form_document_ready`` block in your admin templates
and exclude the shortcuts.js file.

.. code-block:: html

    {% block admin_change_form_document_ready %}
        <script src="{% static 'admin/js/change_form.js' %}" async></script>
        {# shortcuts.js excluded #}
    {% endblock %}

For advanced customization or additional shortcuts, you can extend the
``DjangoAdminShortcuts`` object in your own JavaScript files.
