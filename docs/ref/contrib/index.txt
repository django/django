====================
``contrib`` packages
====================

Django aims to follow Python's `"batteries included" philosophy`_. It ships
with a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common Web-development
problems.

This code lives in ``django/contrib`` in the Django distribution. This document
gives a rundown of the packages in ``contrib``, along with any dependencies
those packages have.

.. admonition:: Note

    For most of these add-ons -- specifically, the add-ons that include either
    models or template tags -- you'll need to add the package name (e.g.,
    ``'django.contrib.admin'``) to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and re-run
    ``manage.py syncdb``.

admin
=====

The automatic Django administrative interface. For more information, see
:doc:`Tutorial 2 </intro/tutorial02>` and the
:doc:`admin documentation </ref/contrib/admin/index>`.

Requires the auth_ and contenttypes_ contrib packages to be installed.

auth
====

Django's authentication framework.

See :doc:`/topics/auth`.

comments
========

.. versionchanged:: 1.0
   The comments application has been rewriten. See :doc:`/ref/contrib/comments/upgrade`
   for information on howto upgrade.

A simple yet flexible comments system. See :doc:`/ref/contrib/comments/index`.

contenttypes
============

A light framework for hooking into "types" of content, where each installed
Django model is a separate content type.

See the :doc:`contenttypes documentation </ref/contrib/contenttypes>`.

csrf
====

A middleware for preventing Cross Site Request Forgeries

See the :doc:`csrf documentation </ref/contrib/csrf>`.

flatpages
=========

A framework for managing simple "flat" HTML content in a database.

See the :doc:`flatpages documentation </ref/contrib/flatpages>`.

Requires the sites_ contrib package to be installed as well.

formtools
=========

A set of high-level abstractions for Django forms (django.forms).

django.contrib.formtools.preview
--------------------------------

An abstraction of the following workflow:

"Display an HTML form, force a preview, then do something with the submission."

See the :doc:`form preview documentation </ref/contrib/formtools/form-preview>`.

django.contrib.formtools.wizard
--------------------------------

Splits forms across multiple Web pages.

See the :doc:`form wizard documentation </ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard>`.

gis
====

A world-class geospatial framework built on top of Django, that enables
storage, manipulation and display of spatial data.

See the :doc:`/ref/contrib/gis/index` documentation for more.

humanize
========

A set of Django template filters useful for adding a "human touch" to data.

See the :doc:`humanize documentation </ref/contrib/humanize>`.

localflavor
===========

A collection of various Django snippets that are useful only for a particular
country or culture. For example, ``django.contrib.localflavor.us.forms``
contains a ``USZipCodeField`` that you can use to validate U.S. zip codes.

See the :doc:`localflavor documentation </ref/contrib/localflavor>`.

.. _ref-contrib-markup:

markup
======

A collection of template filters that implement common markup languages:

    * ``textile`` -- implements `Textile`_ -- requires `PyTextile`_
    * ``markdown`` -- implements `Markdown`_ -- requires `Python-markdown`_
    * ``restructuredtext`` -- implements `ReST (ReStructured Text)`_
      -- requires `doc-utils`_

In each case, the filter expects formatted markup as a string and returns a
string representing the marked-up text. For example, the ``textile`` filter
converts text that is marked-up in Textile format to HTML.

To activate these filters, add ``'django.contrib.markup'`` to your
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Once you've done that, use
``{% load markup %}`` in a template, and you'll have access to these filters.
For more documentation, read the source code in
:file:`django/contrib/markup/templatetags/markup.py`.

.. _Python-markdown: http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown
.. _doc-utils: http://docutils.sf.net/

ReStructured Text
-----------------

When using the `restructuredtext` markup filter you can define a :setting:`RESTRUCTUREDTEXT_FORMAT_SETTINGS`
in your django settings to override the default writer settings. See the `restructuredtext writer settings`_ for
details on what these settings are.

.. _restructuredtext writer settings: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/config.html#html4css1-writer

A framework for storing data in anonymous sessions.

See the :doc:`sessions documentation </topics/http/sessions>`.

sites
=====

A light framework that lets you operate multiple Web sites off of the same
database and Django installation. It gives you hooks for associating objects to
one or more sites.

See the :doc:`sites documentation </ref/contrib/sites>`.

Other add-ons
=============

If you have an idea for functionality to include in ``contrib``, let us know!
Code it up, and post it to the `django-users mailing list`_.
