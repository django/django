====================
``contrib`` packages
====================

Django aims to follow Python's `"batteries included" philosophy`_. It ships
with a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common Web-development
problems.

This code lives in ``django/contrib`` in the Django distribution. This document
gives a rundown of the packages in ``contrib``, along with any dependencies
those packages have.

.. admonition:: Note

    For most of these add-ons -- specifically, the add-ons that include either
    models or template tags -- you'll need to add the package name (e.g.,
    ``'django.contrib.admin'``) to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and re-run
    ``manage.py syncdb``.
