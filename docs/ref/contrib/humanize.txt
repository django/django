   :synopsis: A set of Django template filters useful for adding a "human
              touch" to data.

A set of Django template filters useful for adding a "human touch" to data.

To activate these filters, add ``'django.contrib.humanize'`` to your
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Once you've done that, use
``{% load humanize %}`` in a template, and you'll have access to these filters:

apnumber
--------

For numbers 1-9, returns the number spelled out. Otherwise, returns the
number. This follows Associated Press style.

Examples:

    * ``1`` becomes ``'one'``.
    * ``2`` becomes ``'two'``.
    * ``10`` becomes ``10``.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.

intcomma
--------

Converts an integer to a string containing commas every three digits.

Examples:

    * ``4500`` becomes ``'4,500'``.
    * ``45000`` becomes ``'45,000'``.
    * ``450000`` becomes ``'450,000'``.
    * ``4500000`` becomes ``'4,500,000'``.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.

intword
-------

Converts a large integer to a friendly text representation. Works best for
numbers over 1 million.

Examples:

    * ``1000000`` becomes ``'1.0 million'``.
    * ``1200000`` becomes ``'1.2 million'``.
    * ``1200000000`` becomes ``'1.2 billion'``.

Values up to 1000000000000000 (one quadrillion) are supported.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.

ordinal
-------

Converts an integer to its ordinal as a string.

Examples:

    * ``1`` becomes ``'1st'``.
    * ``2`` becomes ``'2nd'``.
    * ``3`` becomes ``'3rd'``.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.

naturalday
----------

**New in Django development version**

For dates that are the current day or within one day, return "today",
"tomorrow" or "yesterday", as appropriate. Otherwise, format the date using
the passed in format string.

**Argument:** Date formatting string as described in the :ttag:`now` tag.

Examples (when 'today' is 17 Feb 2007):

    * ``16 Feb 2007`` becomes ``yesterday``.
    * ``17 Feb 2007`` becomes ``today``.
    * ``18 Feb 2007`` becomes ``tomorrow``.
    * Any other day is formatted according to given argument or the
      :setting:`DATE_FORMAT` setting if no argument is given.
