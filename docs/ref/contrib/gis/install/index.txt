======================
GeoDjango Installation
======================

Overview
========
In general, GeoDjango installation requires:

#. :ref:`Python and Django <django>`
#. :ref:`spatial_database`
#. :doc:`geolibs`

Details for each of the requirements and installation instructions
are provided in the sections below. In addition, platform-specific
instructions are available for:

* :ref:`macos`
* :ref:`windows`

.. admonition:: Use the Source

    Because GeoDjango takes advantage of the latest in the open source geospatial
    software technology, recent versions of the libraries are necessary.
    If binary packages aren't available for your platform, installation from
    source may be required. When compiling the libraries from source, please
    follow the directions closely, especially if you're a beginner.

Requirements
============

.. _django:

Python and Django
-----------------

Because GeoDjango is included with Django, please refer to Django's
:ref:`installation instructions <installing-official-release>` for details on
how to install.

.. _spatial_database:

Spatial database
----------------
PostgreSQL (with PostGIS), MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite (with SpatiaLite) are the
spatial databases currently supported.

.. note::

    PostGIS is recommended, because it is the most mature and feature-rich
    open source spatial database.

The geospatial libraries required for a GeoDjango installation depends
on the spatial database used.  The following lists the library requirements,
supported versions, and any notes for each of the supported database backends:

==================  ==============================  ==================  =========================================
Database            Library Requirements            Supported Versions  Notes
==================  ==============================  ==================  =========================================
PostgreSQL          GEOS, GDAL, PROJ, PostGIS       12+                 Requires PostGIS.
MySQL               GEOS, GDAL                      8.0.11+             :ref:`Limited functionality <mysql-spatial-limitations>`.
Oracle              GEOS, GDAL                      19+                 XE not supported.
SQLite              GEOS, GDAL, PROJ, SpatiaLite    3.21.0+             Requires SpatiaLite 4.3+

Installation
============

Geospatial libraries
--------------------

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    geolibs

Database installation
---------------------

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    postgis
    spatialite

:setting:`DATABASES` configuration
----------------------------------

Set the :setting:`ENGINE <DATABASE-ENGINE>` setting to one of the :ref:`spatial
backends <spatial-backends>`.

Add ``django.contrib.gis`` to :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`
-------------------------------------------------------

Like other Django contrib applications, you will *only* need to add
:mod:`django.contrib.gis` to :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings.
This is so that the ``gis`` templates can be located -- if not done, then
features such as the geographic admin or KML sitemaps will not function properly.

Troubleshooting
===============

If you can't find the solution to your problem here then participate in the
community!  You can:

* Join the ``#django-geo`` IRC channel on Libera.Chat. Please be patient and
  polite -- while you may not get an immediate response, someone will attempt
  to answer your question as soon as they see it.
* Ask your question on the `GeoDjango`__ forum.
* File a ticket on the `Django trac`__ if you think there's a bug.  Make
  sure to provide a complete description of the problem, versions used,
  and specify the component as "GIS".

.. _libsettings:

Library environment settings
----------------------------

By far, the most common problem when installing GeoDjango is that the
external shared libraries (e.g., for GEOS and GDAL) cannot be located. [#]_
Typically, the cause of this problem is that the operating system isn't aware
of the directory where the libraries built from source were installed.

In general, the library path may be set on a per-user basis by setting
an environment variable, or by configuring the library path for the entire
system.

``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user may set this environment variable to customize the library paths
they want to use.  The typical library directory for software
built from source is ``/usr/local/lib``.  Thus, ``/usr/local/lib`` needs
to be included in the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` variable.  For example, the user
could place the following in their bash profile:

.. code-block:: shell

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

Setting system library path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On GNU/Linux systems, there is typically a file in ``/etc/ld.so.conf``, which may include
additional paths from files in another directory, such as ``/etc/ld.so.conf.d``.
As the root user, add the custom library path (like ``/usr/local/lib``) on a
new line in ``ld.so.conf``.  This is *one* example of how to do so:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf
    $ sudo ldconfig

For OpenSolaris users, the system library path may be modified using the
``crle`` utility.  Run ``crle`` with no options to see the current configuration
and use ``crle -l`` to set with the new library path.  Be *very* careful when
modifying the system library path:

.. code-block:: shell

    # crle -l $OLD_PATH:/usr/local/lib

.. _binutils:

Install ``binutils``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GeoDjango uses the ``find_library`` function (from the ``ctypes.util`` Python
module) to discover libraries.  The ``find_library`` routine uses a program
called ``objdump`` (part of the ``binutils`` package) to verify a shared
library on GNU/Linux systems.  Thus, if ``binutils`` is not installed on your
Linux system then Python's ctypes may not be able to find your library even if
your library path is set correctly and geospatial libraries were built perfectly.

The ``binutils`` package may be installed on Debian and Ubuntu systems using the
following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo apt-get install binutils

Similarly, on Red Hat and CentOS systems:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo yum install binutils

Platform-specific instructions
==============================

.. _macos:

macOS
-----

Because of the variety of packaging systems available for macOS, users have
several different options for installing GeoDjango. These options are:

* :ref:`postgresapp` (easiest and recommended)
* :ref:`homebrew`
* :ref:`fink`
* :ref:`macports`
* :ref:`build_from_source`

This section also includes instructions for installing an upgraded version
of :ref:`macos_python` from packages provided by the Python Software
Foundation, however, this is not required.

.. _macos_python:

Python
~~~~~~

Although macOS comes with Python installed, users can use `framework
installers`__ provided by the Python Software Foundation.  An advantage to
using the installer is that macOS's Python will remain "pristine" for internal
operating system use.

__ https://www.python.org/ftp/python/

.. note::

    You will need to modify the ``PATH`` environment variable in your
    ``.profile`` file so that the new version of Python is used when
    ``python`` is entered at the command-line:

    .. code-block:: shell

        export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:$PATH

.. _postgresapp:

Postgres.app
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Postgres.app <https://postgresapp.com/>`_ is a standalone PostgreSQL server
that includes the PostGIS extension. You will also need to install ``gdal`` and
``libgeoip`` with :ref:`homebrew`.

After installing Postgres.app, add the following to your ``.bash_profile`` so
you can run the package's programs from the command-line. Replace ``X.Y`` with
the version of PostgreSQL in the Postgres.app you installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/X.Y/bin

You can check if the path is set up correctly by typing ``which psql`` at a
terminal prompt.

.. _homebrew:

Homebrew
~~~~~~~~

`Homebrew`__ provides "recipes" for building binaries and packages from source.
It provides recipes for the GeoDjango prerequisites on Macintosh computers
running macOS. Because Homebrew still builds the software from source, `Xcode`_
is required.

Summary:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ brew install postgresql
    $ brew install postgis
    $ brew install gdal
    $ brew install libgeoip

__ https://brew.sh/
.. _Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

.. _fink:

Fink
^^^^

`Kurt Schwehr`__ has been gracious enough to create GeoDjango packages for users
of the `Fink`__ package system. `Different packages are available`__ (starting
with ``django-gis``), depending on which version of Python you want to use.

__ https://www.finkproject.org/
__ https://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/browse.php?summary=django-gis

.. _macports:

MacPorts
~~~~~~~~

`MacPorts`__ may be used to install GeoDjango prerequisites on computers
running macOS.  Because MacPorts still builds the software from source,
`Xcode`_ is required.

Summary:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo port install postgresql13-server
    $ sudo port install geos
    $ sudo port install proj6
    $ sudo port install postgis3
    $ sudo port install gdal
    $ sudo port install libgeoip

.. note::

    You will also have to modify the ``PATH`` in your ``.profile`` so
    that the MacPorts programs are accessible from the command-line:

    .. code-block:: shell

        export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/lib/postgresql13/bin

    In addition, add the ``DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`` setting so that
    the libraries can be found by Python:

    .. code-block:: shell

        export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:/opt/local/lib/postgresql13

__ https://www.macports.org/

.. _windows:

Windows
-------

Proceed through the following sections sequentially in order to install
GeoDjango on Windows. In this tutorial we will install 64 bit versions of each
application.

Python
~~~~~~

Install a 64 bit version of Python. See :doc:`Install Python </howto/windows>`
for further information.

PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~

Download the latest `PostgreSQL 15.x installer`__ from the
`EnterpriseDB`__ website.  After downloading, run the installer, follow the
on-screen directions, and keep the default options unless you know the
consequences of changing them.

.. note::

    The PostgreSQL installer creates a new ``postgres`` database superuser
    You will be prompted once to set the password -- make sure to remember it!

When the installer completes, it will ask to "Launch Stack Builder at exit?" --
keep this checked, as it is necessary to install :ref:`postgisasb`.

.. note::

    If installed successfully, the PostgreSQL server will run in the background
    each time the system as started as a Windows service. A
    :menuselection:`PostgreSQL 15` start menu group will created and contains
    shortcuts for the Application Stack Builder (ASB) as well as the
    'SQL Shell', which will launch a ``psql`` command window.

__ https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
__ https://www.enterprisedb.com

.. _postgisasb:

PostGIS
~~~~~~~

From within the Stack Builder (to run outside of the installer,
:menuselection:`Start --> PostgreSQL 15 --> Application Stack Builder`), select
:menuselection:`PostgreSQL 15 (x64) on port 5432` from the drop down
menu and click next. Expand the
:menuselection:`Categories --> Spatial Extensions` menu tree and select
:menuselection:`PostGIS X.Y for PostgreSQL 15`.

After clicking next, you will be prompted to confirm the selected package and
"Download directory". Click next again, this will download PostGIS and you will
be asked to click next to begin the PostGIS installer. Select the default
options during install. The install process includes four Yes/No dialog boxes,
the default option for all four is "No".

.. _osgeo4w:

OSGeo4W
~~~~~~~

The `OSGeo4W installer`_ helps to install the PROJ, GDAL, and GEOS libraries
required by GeoDjango. First, download the `OSGeo4W installer`_, and
run it. Select :menuselection:`Express Web-GIS Install` and click next.  In the
'Select Packages' list, ensure that GDAL is selected. If any other packages are
enabled by default, they are not required by GeoDjango and may be unchecked
safely. After clicking next and accepting the license agreements, the packages
will be automatically downloaded and installed, after which you may exit the
installer.

.. _OSGeo4W installer: https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/

Modify Windows environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use GeoDjango, you will need to add your OSGeo4W
directories to your Windows system ``Path``, as well as create ``GDAL_DATA``
and ``PROJ_LIB`` environment variables.  The following set of commands,
executable with ``cmd.exe``, will set this up. Restart your device
once this is complete for new environment variables to be recognized:

.. code-block:: bat

    set OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W
    set GDAL_DATA=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\gdal\share\gdal
    set PROJ_LIB=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\share\proj
    set PATH=%PATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin
    reg ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v Path /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /f /d "%PATH%"
    reg ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v GDAL_DATA /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /f /d "%GDAL_DATA%"
    reg ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v PROJ_LIB /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /f /d "%PROJ_LIB%"

.. note::

    Administrator privileges are required to execute these commands.
    To do this, run command prompt as administrator and enter the commands
    above. You need to log out and log back in again for the settings to take
    effect.

.. note::

    If you customized the OSGeo4W installation directories, then you will need
    to modify the ``OSGEO4W_ROOT`` variables accordingly.

Install Django and set up database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Install Django <installing-official-release>` on your system. It is
recommended that you create a :doc:`virtual environment
<python:tutorial/venv>` for each project you create.

psycopg
~~~~~~~

The ``psycopg`` Python module provides the interface between Python and the
PostgreSQL database. ``psycopg`` can be installed via pip within your Python
virtual environment:

.. code-block:: doscon

    ...\> py -m pip install psycopg

.. rubric:: Footnotes
.. [#] GeoDjango uses the :func:`~ctypes.util.find_library` routine from
       ``ctypes.util`` to locate shared libraries.
