======================
Testing GeoDjango apps
======================

Included in this documentation are some additional notes and settings
for :ref:`testing-postgis` users.

.. _testing-postgis:

PostGIS
=======

Settings
--------

.. note::

    The settings below have sensible defaults, and shouldn't require manual setting.

.. setting:: POSTGIS_VERSION

``POSTGIS_VERSION``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When GeoDjango's spatial backend initializes on PostGIS, it has to perform
an SQL query to determine the version in order to figure out what
features are available. Advanced users wishing to prevent this additional
query may set the version manually using a 3-tuple of integers specifying
the major, minor, and micro version numbers for PostGIS. For example,
to configure for PostGIS X.Y.Z you would use::

    POSTGIS_VERSION = (X, Y, Z)

Obtaining sufficient privileges
-------------------------------

Depending on your configuration, this section describes several methods to
configure a database user with sufficient privileges to run tests for
GeoDjango applications on PostgreSQL. If your
:ref:`spatial database template <spatialdb_template>`
was created like in the instructions, then your testing database user
only needs to have the ability to create databases. In other configurations,
you may be required to use a database superuser.

Create database user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a database user with the ability to create databases, use the
following command::

    $ createuser --createdb -R -S <user_name>

The ``-R -S`` flags indicate that we do not want the user to have the ability
to create additional users (roles) or to be a superuser, respectively.

Alternatively, you may alter an existing user's role from the SQL shell
(assuming this is done from an existing superuser account)::

    postgres# ALTER ROLE <user_name> CREATEDB NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEROLE;

Create database superuser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may be done at the time the user is created, for example::

    $ createuser --superuser <user_name>

Or you may alter the user's role from the SQL shell (assuming this
is done from an existing superuser account)::

    postgres# ALTER ROLE <user_name> SUPERUSER;

Windows
-------

On Windows platforms you can use the pgAdmin III utility to add superuser
privileges to your database user.

By default, the PostGIS installer on Windows includes a template
spatial database entitled ``template_postgis``.

.. _geodjango-tests:

GeoDjango tests
===============

To have the GeoDjango tests executed when :ref:`running the Django test suite
<running-unit-tests>` with ``runtests.py`` all of the databases in the settings
file must be using one of the :ref:`spatial database backends
<spatial-backends>`.


Example
-------

The following is an example bare-bones settings file with spatial backends
that can be used to run the entire Django test suite, including those
in :mod:`django.contrib.gis`::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
            'NAME': 'geodjango',
            'USER': 'geodjango',
        },
        'other': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
            'NAME': 'other',
            'USER': 'geodjango',
        },
    }

    SECRET_KEY = 'django_tests_secret_key'

Assuming the settings above were in a ``postgis.py`` file in the same
directory as ``runtests.py``, then all Django and GeoDjango tests would
be performed when executing the command::

    $ ./runtests.py --settings=postgis

To run only the GeoDjango test suite, specify ``gis_tests``::

    $ ./runtests.py --settings=postgis gis_tests
