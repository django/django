.. module:: django.contrib.comments.models
   :synopsis: The built-in comment models
  
.. class:: Comment

    Django's built-in comment model. Has the following fields:
    
    .. attribute:: content_object
    
        A :class:`~django.contrib.contettypes.generic.GenericForeignKey`
        attribute pointing to the object the comment is attached to. You can use
        this to get at the related object (i.e. ``my_comment.content_object``).
        
        Since this field is a
        :class:`~django.contrib.contettypes.generic.GenericForeignKey`, it's
        actually syntactic sugar on top of two underlying attributes, described
        below.
    
    .. attribute:: content_type
   
        A :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey` to
        :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType`; this is the
        type of the object the comment is attached to.
      
    .. attribute:: object_pk
    
        A :class:`~django.db.models.TextField` containing the primary
        key of the object the comment is attached to.
        
    .. attribute:: site
    
        A :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey` to the
        :class:`~django.contrib.sites.models.Site` on which the comment was
        posted.
        
    .. attribute:: user
    
        A :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey` to the
        :class:`~django.contrib.auth.models.User` who posted the comment.
        May be blank if the comment was posted by an unauthenticated user.
        
    .. attribute:: user_name
    
        The name of the user who posted the comment.
    
    .. attribute:: user_email
    
        The email of the user who posted the comment.
    
    .. attribute:: user_url
    
        The URL entered by the person who posted the comment.
    
    .. attribute:: comment
    
        The actual content of the comment itself.
    
    .. attribute:: submit_date
    
        The date the comment was submitted.
    
    .. attribute:: ip_address
    
        The IP address of the user posting the comment.
    
    .. attribute:: is_public
    
        ``False`` if the comment is in moderation (see
        :ref:`ref-contrib-comments-moderation`); If ``True``, the comment will
        be displayed on the site.
    
    .. attribute:: is_removed
    
        ``True`` if the comment was removed. Used to keep track of removed
        comments instead of just deleting them.
