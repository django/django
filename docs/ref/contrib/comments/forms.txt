====================
Comment form classes
====================

.. module:: django.contrib.comments.forms
   :synopsis: Forms for dealing with the built-in comment model.

The ``django.contrib.comments.forms`` module contains a handful of forms
you'll use when writing custom views dealing with comments, or when writing
:ref:`custom comment apps <ref-contrib-comments-custom>`.

.. class:: CommentForm

   The main comment form representing the standard, built-in way of handling
   submitted comments. This is the class used by all the views
   :mod:`django.contrib.comments` to handle submitted comments.

   If you want to build custom views that are similar to Django's built-in
   comment handling views, you'll probably want to use this form.

Abstract comment forms for custom comment apps
----------------------------------------------

If you're building a :ref:`custom comment app <ref-contrib-comments-custom>`,
you might want to replace *some* of the form logic but still rely on parts of
the existing form.

:class:`CommentForm` is actually composed of a couple of abstract base class
forms that you can subclass to reuse pieces of the form handling logic:

.. class:: CommentSecurityForm

   Handles the anti-spoofing protection aspects of the comment form handling.

   This class contains the ``content_type`` and ``object_pk`` fields pointing
   to the object the comment is attached to, along with a ``timestamp`` and a
   ``security_hash`` of all the form data. Together, the timestamp and the
   security hash ensure that spammers can't "replay" form submissions and
   flood you with comments.

.. class:: CommentDetailsForm

   Handles the details of the comment itself.

   This class contains the ``name``, ``email``, ``url``, and the ``comment``
   field itself, along with the associated valdation logic.
