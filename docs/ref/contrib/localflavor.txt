==========================
The "local flavor" add-ons
==========================

.. module:: django.contrib.localflavor
    :synopsis: A collection of various Django snippets that are useful only for
               a particular country or culture.

Following its "batteries included" philosophy, Django comes with assorted
pieces of code that are useful for particular countries or cultures. These are
called the "local flavor" add-ons and live in the
:mod:`django.contrib.localflavor` package.

Inside that package, country- or culture-specific code is organized into
subpackages, named using `ISO 3166 country codes`_.

Most of the ``localflavor`` add-ons are localized form components deriving
from the :doc:`forms </topics/forms/index>` framework -- for example, a
:class:`~django.contrib.localflavor.us.forms.USStateField` that knows how to
validate U.S. state abbreviations, and a
:class:`~django.contrib.localflavor.fi.forms.FISocialSecurityNumber` that
knows how to validate Finnish social security numbers.

To use one of these localized components, just import the relevant subpackage.
For example, here's how you can create a form with a field representing a
French telephone number::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib.localflavor.fr.forms import FRPhoneNumberField

    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        my_french_phone_no = FRPhoneNumberField()

Supported countries
===================

Countries currently supported by :mod:`~django.contrib.localflavor` are:

    * Argentina_
    * Australia_
    * Austria_
    * Belgium_
    * Brazil_
    * Canada_
    * Chile_
    * Czech_
    * Finland_
    * France_
    * Germany_
    * Iceland_
    * India_
    * Indonesia_
    * Ireland_
    * Israel_
    * Italy_
    * Japan_
    * Kuwait_
    * Mexico_
    * `The Netherlands`_
    * Norway_
    * Peru_
    * Poland_
    * Portugal_
    * Romania_
    * Slovakia_
    * `South Africa`_
    * Spain_
    * Sweden_
    * Switzerland_
    * `United Kingdom`_
    * `United States of America`_
    * Uruguay_

The ``django.contrib.localflavor`` package also includes a ``generic`` subpackage,
containing useful code that is not specific to one particular country or culture.
Currently, it defines date, datetime and split datetime input fields based on
those from :doc:`forms </topics/forms/index>`, but with non-US default formats.
Here's an example of how to use them::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib.localflavor import generic

    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        my_date_field = generic.forms.DateField()

Adding flavors
==============

We'd love to add more of these to Django, so please `create a ticket`_ with
any code you'd like to contribute. One thing we ask is that you please use
Unicode objects (``u'mystring'``) for strings, rather than setting the encoding
in the file. See any of the existing flavors for examples.
