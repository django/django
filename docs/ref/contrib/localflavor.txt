==========================
The "local flavor" add-ons
==========================

.. module:: django.contrib.localflavor
    :synopsis: A collection of various Django snippets that are useful only for
               a particular country or culture.

Following its "batteries included" philosophy, Django comes with assorted
pieces of code that are useful for particular countries or cultures. These are
called the "local flavor" add-ons and live in the
:mod:`django.contrib.localflavor` package.

Inside that package, country- or culture-specific code is organized into
subpackages, named using `ISO 3166 country codes`_.

Most of the ``localflavor`` add-ons are localized form components deriving
from the :doc:`forms </topics/forms/index>` framework -- for example, a
:class:`~django.contrib.localflavor.us.forms.USStateField` that knows how to
validate U.S. state abbreviations, and a
:class:`~django.contrib.localflavor.fi.forms.FISocialSecurityNumber` that
knows how to validate Finnish social security numbers.

To use one of these localized components, just import the relevant subpackage.
For example, here's how you can create a form with a field representing a
French telephone number::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib.localflavor.fr.forms import FRPhoneNumberField

    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        my_french_phone_no = FRPhoneNumberField()

Supported countries
===================

Countries currently supported by :mod:`~django.contrib.localflavor` are:

* Argentina_
* Australia_
* Austria_
* Belgium_
* Brazil_
* Canada_
* Chile_
* China_
* Colombia_
* Croatia_
* Czech_
* Ecuador_
* Finland_
* France_
* Germany_
* `Hong Kong`_
* Iceland_
* India_
* Indonesia_
* Ireland_
* Israel_
* Italy_
* Japan_
* Kuwait_
* Macedonia_
* Mexico_
* `The Netherlands`_
* Norway_
* Peru_
* Poland_
* Portugal_
* Paraguay_
* Romania_
* Russia_
* Slovakia_
* Slovenia_
* `South Africa`_
* Spain_
* Sweden_
* Switzerland_
* Turkey_
* `United Kingdom`_
* `United States of America`_
* Uruguay_

The ``django.contrib.localflavor`` package also includes a ``generic`` subpackage,
containing useful code that is not specific to one particular country or culture.
Currently, it defines date, datetime and split datetime input fields based on
those from :doc:`forms </topics/forms/index>`, but with non-US default formats.
Here's an example of how to use them::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib.localflavor import generic

    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        my_date_field = generic.forms.DateField()

Internationalization of localflavor
===================================

Localflavor has its own catalog of translations, in the directory
``django/contrib/localflavor/locale``, and it's not loaded automatically like
Django's general catalog in ``django/conf/locale``. If you want localflavor's
texts to be translated, like form fields error messages, you must include
:mod:`django.contrib.localflavor` in the :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting, so
the internationalization system can find the catalog, as explained in
:ref:`how-django-discovers-translations`.

Adding flavors
==============

We'd love to add more of these to Django, so please `create a ticket`_ with
any code you'd like to contribute. One thing we ask is that you please use
Unicode objects (``u'mystring'``) for strings, rather than setting the encoding
in the file. See any of the existing flavors for examples.

.. _create a ticket: https://code.djangoproject.com/simpleticket

Localflavor and backwards compatibility
=======================================

As documented in our :ref:`API stability
<misc-api-stability-localflavor>` policy, Django will always attempt
to make :mod:`django.contrib.localflavor` reflect the officially
gazetted policies of the appropriate local government authority. For
example, if a government body makes a change to add, alter, or remove
a province (or state, or county), that change will be reflected in
Django's localflavor in the next stable Django release.

When a backwards-incompatible change is made (for example, the removal
or renaming of a province) the localflavor in question will raise a
warning when that localflavor is imported. This provides a runtime
indication that something may require attention.

However, once you have addressed the backwards compatibility (for
example, auditing your code to see if any data migration is required),
the warning serves no purpose. The warning can then be supressed.
For example, to suppress the warnings raised by the Indonesian
localflavor you would use the following code::

    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore',
                            category=RuntimeWarning,
                            module='django.contrib.localflavor.id')
