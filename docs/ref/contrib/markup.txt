django.contrib.markup
=====================

.. module:: django.contrib.markup
   :synopsis: A collection of template filters that implement common markup languages.

Django provides template filters that implement the following markup
languages:

* ``textile`` -- implements `Textile`_ -- requires `PyTextile`_
* ``markdown`` -- implements `Markdown`_ -- requires `Python-markdown`_
* ``restructuredtext`` -- implements `reST (reStructured Text)`_
  -- requires `doc-utils`_

In each case, the filter expects formatted markup as a string and
returns a string representing the marked-up text. For example, the
``textile`` filter converts text that is marked-up in Textile format
to HTML.

To activate these filters, add ``'django.contrib.markup'`` to your
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Once you've done that, use
``{% load markup %}`` in a template, and you'll have access to these filters.
For more documentation, read the source code in
:file:`django/contrib/markup/templatetags/markup.py`.

.. warning::

    The output of markup filters is marked "safe" and will not be escaped when
    rendered in a template. Always be careful to sanitize your inputs and make
    sure you are not leaving yourself vulnerable to cross-site scripting or
    other types of attacks.

reStructured Text
-----------------

When using the ``restructuredtext`` markup filter you can define a
:setting:`RESTRUCTUREDTEXT_FILTER_SETTINGS` in your django settings to
override the default writer settings. See the `restructuredtext writer
settings`_ for details on what these settings are.

.. warning::

   reStructured Text has features that allow raw HTML to be included, and that
   allow arbitrary files to be included. These can lead to XSS vulnerabilities
   and leaking of private information. It is your responsibility to check the
   features of this library and configure appropriately to avoid this. See the
   `Deploying Docutils Securely
   <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/security.html>`_ documentation.

Markdown
--------

The Python Markdown library supports options named "safe_mode" and
"enable_attributes". Both relate to the security of the output. To use the safe
settings of both options, the markdown filter supports the "safe" argument::

    {{ markdown_content_var|markdown:"safe" }}

.. warning::

    Versions of the Python-Markdown library prior to 2.1 do not support the
    optional disabling of attributes and by default they will be included in
    any output from the markdown filter - a warning is issued if this is the
    case.
