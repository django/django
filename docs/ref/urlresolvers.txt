``django.core.urlresolvers`` utility functions
==============================================

.. module:: django.core.urlresolvers

reverse()
---------

If you need to use something similar to the :ttag:`url` template tag in
your code, Django provides the following function:

.. function:: reverse(viewname, [urlconf=None, args=None, kwargs=None, current_app=None])

``viewname`` is either the function name (either a function reference, or the
string version of the name, if you used that form in ``urlpatterns``) or the
:ref:`URL pattern name <naming-url-patterns>`.  Normally, you won't need to
worry about the ``urlconf`` parameter and will only pass in the positional and
keyword arguments to use in the URL matching. For example::

    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse

    def myview(request):
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('arch-summary', args=[1945]))

The ``reverse()`` function can reverse a large variety of regular expression
patterns for URLs, but not every possible one. The main restriction at the
moment is that the pattern cannot contain alternative choices using the
vertical bar (``"|"``) character. You can quite happily use such patterns for
matching against incoming URLs and sending them off to views, but you cannot
reverse such patterns.

The ``current_app`` argument allows you to provide a hint to the resolver
indicating the application to which the currently executing view belongs.
This ``current_app`` argument is used as a hint to resolve application
namespaces into URLs on specific application instances, according to the
:ref:`namespaced URL resolution strategy <topics-http-reversing-url-namespaces>`.

You can use ``kwargs`` instead of ``args``. For example::

    >>> reverse('admin:app_list', kwargs={'app_label': 'auth'})
    '/admin/auth/'

``args`` and ``kwargs`` cannot be passed to ``reverse()`` at the same time.

.. admonition:: Make sure your views are all correct.

    As part of working out which URL names map to which patterns, the
    ``reverse()`` function has to import all of your URLconf files and examine
    the name of each view. This involves importing each view function. If
    there are *any* errors whilst importing any of your view functions, it
    will cause ``reverse()`` to raise an error, even if that view function is
    not the one you are trying to reverse.

    Make sure that any views you reference in your URLconf files exist and can
    be imported correctly. Do not include lines that reference views you
    haven't written yet, because those views will not be importable.

.. note::

    The string returned by ``reverse()`` is already
    :ref:`urlquoted <uri-and-iri-handling>`. For example::

        >>> reverse('cities', args=[u'Orléans'])
        '.../Orl%C3%A9ans/'

    Applying further encoding (such as :meth:`~django.utils.http.urlquote` or
    ``urllib.quote``) to the output of ``reverse()`` may produce undesirable
    results.

reverse_lazy()
--------------

A lazily evaluated version of `reverse()`_.

.. function:: reverse_lazy(viewname, [urlconf=None, args=None, kwargs=None, current_app=None])

It is useful for when you need to use a URL reversal before your project's
URLConf is loaded. Some common cases where this function is necessary are:

* providing a reversed URL as the ``url`` attribute of a generic class-based
  view.

* providing a reversed URL to a decorator (such as the ``login_url`` argument
  for the :func:`django.contrib.auth.decorators.permission_required`
  decorator).

* providing a reversed URL as a default value for a parameter in a function's
  signature.

resolve()
---------

The ``resolve()`` function can be used for resolving URL paths to the
corresponding view functions. It has the following signature:

.. function:: resolve(path, urlconf=None)

``path`` is the URL path you want to resolve. As with
:func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse`, you don't need to
worry about the ``urlconf`` parameter. The function returns a
:class:`ResolverMatch` object that allows you
to access various meta-data about the resolved URL.

If the URL does not resolve, the function raises an
:class:`~django.http.Http404` exception.

.. class:: ResolverMatch

    .. attribute:: ResolverMatch.func

        The view function that would be used to serve the URL

    .. attribute:: ResolverMatch.args

        The arguments that would be passed to the view function, as
        parsed from the URL.

    .. attribute:: ResolverMatch.kwargs

        The keyword arguments that would be passed to the view
        function, as parsed from the URL.

    .. attribute:: ResolverMatch.url_name

        The name of the URL pattern that matches the URL.

    .. attribute:: ResolverMatch.app_name

        The application namespace for the URL pattern that matches the
        URL.

    .. attribute:: ResolverMatch.namespace

        The instance namespace for the URL pattern that matches the
        URL.

    .. attribute:: ResolverMatch.namespaces

        The list of individual namespace components in the full
        instance namespace for the URL pattern that matches the URL.
        i.e., if the namespace is ``foo:bar``, then namespaces will be
        ``['foo', 'bar']``.

A :class:`ResolverMatch` object can then be interrogated to provide
information about the URL pattern that matches a URL::

    # Resolve a URL
    match = resolve('/some/path/')
    # Print the URL pattern that matches the URL
    print(match.url_name)

A :class:`ResolverMatch` object can also be assigned to a triple::

    func, args, kwargs = resolve('/some/path/')

One possible use of :func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.resolve` would be to test
whether a view would raise a ``Http404`` error before redirecting to it::

    from urlparse import urlparse
    from django.core.urlresolvers import resolve
    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect, Http404

    def myview(request):
        next = request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER', None) or '/'
        response = HttpResponseRedirect(next)

        # modify the request and response as required, e.g. change locale
        # and set corresponding locale cookie

        view, args, kwargs = resolve(urlparse(next)[2])
        kwargs['request'] = request
        try:
            view(*args, **kwargs)
        except Http404:
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/')
        return response

get_script_prefix()
-------------------

.. function:: get_script_prefix()

Normally, you should always use :func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse` to
define URLs within your application. However, if your application constructs
part of the URL hierarchy itself, you may occasionally need to generate URLs.
In that case, you need to be able to find the base URL of the Django project
within its Web server (normally, :func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse`
takes care of this for you). In that case, you can call
``get_script_prefix()``, which will return the script prefix portion of the URL
for your Django project. If your Django project is at the root of its web
server, this is always ``"/"``.
