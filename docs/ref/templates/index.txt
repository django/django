=========

Django's template engine provides a powerful mini-language for defining the
user-facing layer of your application, encouraging a clean separation of
application and presentation logic. Templates can be maintained by anyone with
an understanding of HTML; no knowledge of Python is required. For introductory
material, see :doc:`/topics/templates` topic guide.
