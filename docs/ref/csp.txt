Content Security Policy
=======================

.. versionadded:: 6.0

.. module:: django.middleware.csp
   :synopsis: Middleware for Content Security Policy headers

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a web security standard that helps prevent
content injection attacks by restricting the sources from which content can be
loaded. It plays an important role in a comprehensive :ref:`security strategy
<security-csp>`.

For configuration instructions in a Django project, see the :ref:`Using CSP
<csp-config>` documentation. For an HTTP guide about CSP, see the `MDN Guide on
CSP <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP>`_.

.. _csp-overview:

Overview
========

The `Content-Security-Policy specification <https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/>`_
defines two complementary headers:

* ``Content-Security-Policy``: Enforces the CSP policy, blocking content that
  violates the defined directives.
* ``Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only``: Reports CSP violations without
  blocking content, allowing for non-intrusive testing.

Each policy is composed of one or more directives and their values, which
together instruct the browser on how to handle specific types of content.

When the :class:`~django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware` is
enabled, Django automatically builds and attaches the appropriate headers to
each response based on the configured :ref:`settings <csp-settings>`, unless
they have already been set by another layer.

.. _csp-settings:

Settings
========

The :class:`~django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware` is
configured using the following settings:

* :setting:`SECURE_CSP`: defines the **enforced Content Security Policy**.
* :setting:`SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY`: defines a **report-only Content Security
  Policy**.

.. admonition:: These settings can be used independently or together

   * Use :setting:`SECURE_CSP` alone to enforce a policy that has already been
     tested and verified.
   * Use :setting:`SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY` on its own to evaluate a new policy
     without disrupting site behavior. This mode does not block violations, it
     only logs them. It's useful for testing and monitoring, but provides no
     protection against active threats.
   * Use *both* to maintain an enforced baseline while experimenting with
     changes. Even for well-established policies, continuing to collect reports
     reports can help detect regressions, unexpected changes in behavior, or
     potential tampering in production environments.

.. _csp-reports:

Policy violation reports
========================

When a CSP violation occurs, browsers typically log details to the developer
console, providing immediate feedback during development. To also receive these
reports programmatically, the policy must include a `reporting directive
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#reporting_directives>`_
such as ``report-uri`` that specifies where violation data should be sent.

Django supports configuring these directives via the
:setting:`SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY` settings, but reports will only be issued by
the browser if the policy explicitly includes a valid reporting directive.

Django does not provide built-in functionality to receive, store, or process
violation reports. To collect and analyze them, you must implement your own
reporting endpoint or integrate with a third-party monitoring service.

.. _csp-constants:

CSP constants
=============

Django provides predefined constants representing common CSP source expression
keywords such as ``'self'``, ``'none'``, and ``'unsafe-inline'``. These
constants are intended for use in the directive values defined in the settings.

They are available through the :class:`~django.utils.csp.CSP` enum, and using
them is recommended over raw strings. This helps avoid common mistakes such as
typos, improper quoting, or inconsistent formatting, and ensures compliance
with the CSP specification.

.. module:: django.utils.csp
   :synopsis: Constants for Content Security Policy

.. class:: CSP

   Enum providing standardized constants for common CSP source expressions.

   .. attribute:: NONE

      Represents ``'none'``. Blocks loading resources for the given directive.

   .. attribute:: REPORT_SAMPLE

      Represents ``'report-sample'``. Instructs the browser to include a sample
      of the violating code in reports. Note that this may expose sensitive
      data.

   .. attribute:: SELF

      Represents ``'self'``. Allows loading resources from the same origin
      (same scheme, host, and port).

   .. attribute:: STRICT_DYNAMIC

      Represents ``'strict-dynamic'``. Allows execution of scripts loaded by a
      trusted script (e.g., one with a valid nonce or hash), without needing
      ``'unsafe-inline'``.

   .. attribute:: UNSAFE_EVAL

      Represents ``'unsafe-eval'``. Allows use of ``eval()`` and similar
      JavaScript functions. Strongly discouraged.

   .. attribute:: UNSAFE_HASHES

      Represents ``'unsafe-hashes'``. Allows inline event handlers and some
      ``javascript:`` URIs when their content hashes match a policy rule.
      Requires CSP Level 3+.

   .. attribute:: UNSAFE_INLINE

      Represents ``'unsafe-inline'``. Allows execution of inline scripts,
      styles, and ``javascript:`` URLs. Generally discouraged, especially for
      scripts.

   .. attribute:: WASM_UNSAFE_EVAL

      Represents ``'wasm-unsafe-eval'``. Permits compilation and execution of
      WebAssembly code without enabling ``'unsafe-eval'`` for scripts.

   .. attribute:: NONCE

      Django-specific placeholder value (``"<CSP_NONCE_SENTINEL>"``) used in
      ``script-src`` or ``style-src`` directives to activate nonce-based CSP.
      This string is replaced at runtime by the
      :class:`~django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware` with a
      secure, random nonce that is generated for each request. See detailed
      explanation in :ref:`csp-nonce`.

.. _csp-nonce:

Nonce usage
===========

A CSP nonce ("number used once") is a unique, random value generated per HTTP
response. Django supports nonces as a secure way to allow specific inline
``<script>`` or ``<style>`` elements to execute without relying on
``'unsafe-inline'``.

Nonces are enabled by including the special placeholder
:attr:`~django.utils.csp.CSP.NONCE` in the relevant directive(s) of your
:ref:`CSP settings <csp-settings>`, such as ``script-src`` or ``style-src``.
When present, the
:class:`~django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware`
will generate a nonce and insert the corresponding ``nonce-<value>`` source
expression into the CSP header.

To use this nonce in templates, the
:func:`~django.template.context_processors.csp` context processor needs to be
enabled. It adds a ``csp_nonce`` variable to the template context, allowing
inline elements to include a matching ``nonce={{ csp_nonce }}`` attribute in
inline scripts or styles.

The browser will only execute inline elements that include a ``nonce=<value>``
attribute matching the one specified in the ``Content-Security-Policy`` (or
``Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only``) header. This mechanism provides
fine-grained control over which inline code is allowed to run.

If a template includes ``{{ csp_nonce }}`` but the policy does not include
:attr:`~django.utils.csp.CSP.NONCE`, the HTML will include a nonce attribute,
but the header will lack the required source expression. In this case, the
browser will block the inline script or style (or report it for report-only
configurations).

Nonce generation and caching
----------------------------

Django's nonce generation is **lazy**: the middleware only generates a nonce if
``{{ csp_nonce }}`` is accessed during template rendering. This avoids
unnecessary work for pages that do not use nonces.

However, because nonces must be unique per request, extra care is needed when
using full-page caching (e.g., Django's cache middleware, CDN caching). Serving
cached responses with previously generated nonces may result in reuse across
users and requests. Although such responses may still appear to work (since the
nonce in the CSP header and HTML content match), reuse defeats the purpose of
the nonce and weakens security.

To ensure nonce-based policies remain effective:

* Avoid caching full responses that include ``{{ csp_nonce }}``.
* If caching is necessary, use a strategy that injects a fresh nonce on each
  request, or consider refactoring your application to avoid inline scripts and
  styles altogether.
