How to customize the ``shell`` command
======================================

The Django :djadmin:`shell` is an interactive Python environment that provides
access to models and settings, making it useful for testing code, experimenting
with queries, and interacting with application data.

Customizing the :djadmin:`shell` command allows adding extra functionality or
pre-loading specific modules. To do this, create a new management command that subclasses
``django.core.management.commands.shell.Command`` and overrides the existing
``shell`` management command. For more details, refer to the guide on
:ref:`overriding commands <overriding-commands>`.

Customize automatic imports
===========================

.. versionadded:: 5.2

To customize the automatic import behavior of the :djadmin:`shell` management
command, override the ``get_namespace()`` method. For example:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``polls/management/commands/shell.py``

    from django.core.management.commands import shell


    class Command(shell.Command):
        def get_namespace(self):
            from django.urls.base import resolve, reverse

            return {
                **super().get_namespace(),
                "resolve": resolve,
                "reverse": reverse,
            }

The above customization adds :func:`~django.urls.resolve` and
:func:`~django.urls.reverse` to the default namespace, which includes all
models from all apps. These two functions will then be available when the
shell opens, without a manual import statement.
