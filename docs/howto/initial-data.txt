Providing initial data for models
=================================

It's sometimes useful to pre-populate your database with hard-coded data when
you're first setting up an app. You can provide initial data with fixtures or
migrations.

Providing initial data with fixtures
====================================

A fixture is a collection of data that Django knows how to import into a
database. The most straightforward way of creating a fixture if you've already
got some data is to use the :djadmin:`manage.py dumpdata <dumpdata>` command.
Or, you can write fixtures by hand; fixtures can be written as JSON, XML or YAML
(with PyYAML_ installed) documents. The :doc:`serialization documentation
</topics/serialization>` has more details about each of these supported
:ref:`serialization formats <serialization-formats>`.

.. _PyYAML: http://www.pyyaml.org/

As an example, though, here's what a fixture for a simple ``Person`` model might
look like in JSON:

.. code-block:: js

    [
      {
        "model": "myapp.person",
        "pk": 1,
        "fields": {
          "first_name": "John",
          "last_name": "Lennon"
        }
      },
      {
        "model": "myapp.person",
        "pk": 2,
        "fields": {
          "first_name": "Paul",
          "last_name": "McCartney"
        }
      }
    ]

And here's that same fixture as YAML:

.. code-block:: none

    - model: myapp.person
      pk: 1
      fields:
        first_name: John
        last_name: Lennon
    - model: myapp.person
      pk: 2
      fields:
        first_name: Paul
        last_name: McCartney

You'll store this data in a ``fixtures`` directory inside your app.

Loading data is easy: just call :djadmin:`manage.py loaddata <loaddata>`
``<fixturename>``, where ``<fixturename>`` is the name of the fixture file
you've created. Each time you run :djadmin:`loaddata`, the data will be read
from the fixture and re-loaded into the database. Note this means that if you
change one of the rows created by a fixture and then run :djadmin:`loaddata`
again, you'll wipe out any changes you've made.

Where Django finds fixture files
--------------------------------

By default, Django looks in the ``fixtures`` directory inside each app for
fixtures, so the command ``loaddata sample`` would find the file
``my_app/fixtures/sample.json``.  This works with relative paths as
well, so ``loaddata my_app/sample`` will find the file
``my_app/fixtures/my_app/sample.json``.  If you want to suppress the
usual search, use an absolute path to specify the location of
your fixture file, as in ``loaddata /path/to/sample``.

You can set the :setting:`FIXTURE_DIRS` setting to a list of
additional directories where Django should look for fixtures.

.. admonition:: Fixture file namespacing

    Django will use the first fixture file it finds whose name matches,
    so if you have fixture files with the same name in
    different applications, you will be unable to
    distinguish between them in your loaddata commands.
    The easiest way to avoid this problem is by *namespacing* your
    fixture files; that is, by putting them inside a directory named
    for their application, as in the relative path example above.

    Fixtures are also used by the :ref:`testing framework
    <topics-testing-fixtures>` to help set up a consistent test environment.

Providing initial data with migrations
======================================

If you want to automatically load initial data for an app, don't use fixtures.
Instead, create a migration for your application with
:class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython` or
:class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL` operations.
