===================================
Managing static files (CSS, images)
===================================

Websites generally need to serve additional files such as images, JavaScript,
or CSS. In Django, we refer to these files as "static files".  Django provides
:mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles` to help you manage them.

This page describes how you can serve these static files.


Configuring static files
========================

1. In your settings file, define :setting:`STATIC_URL`, for example::

   `/static/`.

2. In your templates, either hardcode the url like
   ``/static/my_app/myexample.jpg`` or preferably, use the static template tag
   to point to the right url (this makes it much easier when you want to
   switch to for example Amazon for serving static files).

   .. _staticfiles-in-templates:

   .. code-block:: html+django

        {% load staticfiles %}
        <img src="{% static "my_app/myexample.jpg" %}" alt="Sample image"/>

3. Store your static files in a folder called ``static`` in your app. For
   example ``my_app/static/my_app/myimage.jpg``.

Now, if you use ``./manage.py runserver``, all static files should be shown
correctly.

.. admonition:: Static file namespacing

    Now we *might* be able to get away with putting our static files directly
    in ``polls/static`` (rather than creating another ``polls`` subdirectory),
    but it would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first static
    file it finds whose name matches, and if you had a static file with the
    same name in a *different* application, Django would be unable to
    distinguish between them. We need to be able to point Django at the right
    one, and the easiest way to ensure this is by *namespacing* them. That is,
    by putting those static files inside *another* directory named for the
    application itself.

Alternatively to using a ``static/`` directory inside your apps, you can
define a list of directories (:setting:`STATICFILES_DIRS`) in your settings
file where Django will additionally look for static files. For example::

    STATICFILES_DIRS = (
        os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),
        '/var/www/static/',
    )

For complete details on all the settings, commands, template tags, and other
pieces included in :mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles`, see :doc:`the staticfiles
reference </ref/contrib/staticfiles>`.


Serving files uploaded by a user
================================

During development, you can serve user-uploaded media files from
:setting:`MEDIA_ROOT`.  using, the :func:`~django.views.static.serve`
view. For clarity, this is not suitable for production use. For some common
deployment strategies, see :doc:`/howto/static-files-in-production`.

For example, if your :setting:`MEDIA_URL` is defined as '/media/', you can do
this by adding the following snippet to your urls.py::

    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
    ) + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

.. note::

    This helper function works only in debug mode and only if
    the given prefix is local (e.g. ``/static/``) and not a URL (e.g.
    ``http://static.example.com/``).

Deployment
==========

:mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles` provides convenience functions for gathering
static files in a single directory so you can serve them easily.

1. Set the :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` setting to point to the directory from which
   you'd like to serve these files, for example::

       STATIC_ROOT = "/var/www/example.com/static/"

2. Run the :djadmin:`collectstatic` management command::

       ./manage.py collectstatic

   This will copy all files in your static folders and copy them into the
   directory defined by :setting:`STATIC_ROOT`.

3. Use a webserver of your choice to serve the files.

   :doc:`/howto/static-files-in-production` covers some common deployment
   strategies for static files.
