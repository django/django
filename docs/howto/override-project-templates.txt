How to change the files generated from ``startproject`` and ``startapp``
========================================================================


Introduction
============

The first command you will run when setting up a django project is
:djadmin:`startproject`. Having set up your project, you will then start
creating your apps with :djadmin:`startapp`. Each of these commands will create
a file structure that is based on default templates within the Django
repository.

However, you can create your own templates so that when you run
:djadmin:`startproject` or :djadmin:`startapp` it creates the app and project
structure that is best for you.

What the defaults look like
===========================

The command :djadmin:`startproject` will create the ``manage.py`` file, along
with a folder named after the ``project_name`` parameter passed in the initial
command. Here the command is run with the project name as ``myproject``:

.. console::

   $ django-admin startproject myproject .

The resulting file structure is based on the default template-file structure in
(:source:`django/conf/project_templates`). There, each file has the extension
``.py-tpl`` to denote the file as a template. Each template contains template
tags that end up being filled from the command and django version context. The
template context is detailed at the end of the documentation for
:djadmin:`startproject`.

The resulting files all have the ``.py`` file extension and are ready to be
used:

.. code-block:: none

    myproject/
        manage.py
        myproject/
            __init__.py
            asgi.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py

A similar thing happens when you run :djadmin:`startapp`. Both commands inherit
from the same ``TemplateCommand`` class (in
:source:`django/core/management/templates.py`), but they discern between app
and project.

A typical command to initialize an app with the name ``myapp``:

.. console::

   $ python manage.py startapp myapp .

This creates an app in the current directory with the default file structure
found in (:source:`django/conf/app_templates`). As above, each template  has
the extension ``.py-tpl`` to denote the file as a template, but is copied over
as a python file. Each template contains template tags for the variables that
will be passed.

.. code-block:: none

    myapp/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py


Creating your own Project and App Templates
===========================================

The default project and app file structures are the ones suggested by django,
but not the only ones that can be used. Because django does not require a
specific file structure for the ``settings`` or ``urls`` files, you can create
your own structure. The only thing to watch out for is that the imports and
references to other modules is correct. As long as the files find each other,
it doesn't matter where they are placed.

The folders that contain your templates can have any naming convention.
``new_django_template`` is as valid as ``files_structure``. You can even have
them as a directory, as a zip file or a compressed or uncompressed archive. In
addition, you can pull them from the web as long as they are in a valid format.

File and folder naming conventions
----------------------------------

There is, however, a specific naming convention that needs to be followed in
order to have your project name as the folder name enclosing the settings
files.  In the project template, the folder that uses the name you pass in the
:djadmin:`startproject` command must be named ``project_name``. This name is
then replaced by the name you enter when you run the command. In the example at
the top of the page the template folder ``project_name``  would be replaced
with ``myapp``.

For the :djadmin:`startapp` command, this is not necessary, as the folder
enclosing the files ``admin.py`` and ``urls.py`` is the folder of the app
template, and the command will take the contents of this folder, and move them
to a folder with the name passed in the command.

However, you can leverage the app name or project name if you have a file or
folder that needs to use the name. Because this substitution happens using
Python's string ``replace`` function, you can have something like a separate
settings folder in your template with the name ``project_name_settings`` and
the folder name will be changed, as in the above example to
``myproject_settings``. The same is true for files with ``project_name`` as
part of their name. For apps, you should have folders or files with
``app_name`` within their name. In our example, ``app_name`` would be replaced
by ``myapp`` and ``app_name_utilities`` would be replaced by
``myapp_utilities``.

File structure of the templates
-------------------------------

Neither the :djadmin:`startproject` nor the :djadmin:`startapp` commands
generate the code in the files. They only copy existing files and (when
applicable) insert the context. When the files are copied from a custom project
template, they are copied directly without any code modifications from the
default templates. It is up to the developer to make sure that the template
file structure and code actually works, and that they contain up-to-date code,
settings, and variables for the version of django being used. When updating the
Django version, it is recommended to double-check against the default project
or app template files to see what has been added or changed. It is highly
recommended to start a django project first, make sure that the files work
together, and then create a template based on that file structure and content.

As a example, a flat Django project can look like this, with all of the files
normally found in the project folder outside that folder, and at the same level
as ``manage.py``:

.. code-block:: none

    myproject/
        asgi.py
        manage.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py


In this particular instance, to make the files work with each other, you'd have
to adapt the settings reference in ``manage.py`` to refer to ``"settings"``
instead of ``"myproject.settings"`` since your ``settings.py`` file is no
longer in the created ``myproject`` folder, but at the same level as
``manage.py``. Likewise in ``settings.py``, you'd have to change the value of
:settings:`ROOT_URLCONF` from ``"myproject.urls"`` to simply ``"urls"`` and
:settings:`WSGI_APPLICATION` from ``"myproject.wsgi.application"`` to
``"wsgi.application"``.

For the :djadmin:`startapp` command, there is less that can be customized since
it is a single folder with files and a migrations folder within. If certain
files are not needed they can be left out. For example, if no models will be
used, the ``models.py`` file and the ``migrations`` folder can be left out. In
this case the ``admin.py`` file could also be left off. Conversely, if you
always use custom managers, you could add a ``managers.py`` file to your custom
structure to make sure the file is always there.

Template suffixes
-----------------

For convenience, python files used in the templates use the suffix ``.py-tpl``.
During the process of creating the project or app files, the suffix is changed
to ``.py``. However, this is not absolutely necessary, since any files with the
``.py`` suffix can have the context changed by the templating engine if they
contain template tags that are variables.


Templating non-Python files
---------------------------

Since the commands that use the templates just copy files, you can have any
type of file in the project or app template. This is especially useful if you
want to set up frontend or infrastructure files within the project template.

Any type of file is supported as long as it doesn't end with ``.pyo``,
``.pyc``, or ``.py.class``. Any type of directory is supported as long as it
doesn't begin with a period ``.`` (hidden directory) or is a ``__pycache__``
file.

You can even use the template engine to fill in ``{{ project_name }}`` in
places where the project name would be commonly used by other apps, such as in
Kubernetes or Docker files.


Excluding parts of files from templating
----------------------------------------

The templating engine will overwrite any context variables found in the project
or app template. Sometimes, for the purposes of documentation, you want to
leave the variables visible in the produced app or project structure. To have
``{{ django_version }}`` or ``{{ project_name }}`` still visible in the
resulting file, you can wrap that part of the file, or even the whole file with
the template tags ``{% verbatim %}`` and ``{% endverbatim %}``. The templating
engine will end up removing them from the finished file.


Using your templates
====================

The basic command to start your project using your new template is:

.. console::

    $ django-admin startproject myproject .

To add non-python files to the templating engine, add the names to the
``extension`` flag like so:

.. console::

    $ django-admin startproject myproject . --extension js,toml

So now all Javascript and toml files will be run through the templating engine
to replace any variables.

If you are using any non-python files that you need run through the templating
engine that do not have extensions, such as ``Dockerfile`` or ``.gitignore``,
or for files with extensions in which only some files should go through the
template engine, you can add them individually after the ``name`` flag:

.. console::

    $ django-admin startproject myproject . --name Dockerfile,.gitignore

To exclude any directories from being affected by the template engine, you can
use the ``exclude`` flag and they will be removed from the folders to go
through templating:

.. console::

    $ django-admin startproject myproject . --exclude frontend,reference

The flag usage above holds true for ``python manage.py startapp .``, but,
instead, you would be working on the app level instead of the project level.

:djadmin:`startproject` and :djadmin:`startapp`.
