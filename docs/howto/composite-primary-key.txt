How to define a composite primary key
=====================================

.. versionadded:: 5.2

In Django, each model has a primary key. By default, this primary key consists
of a single field.

In most cases, a single primary key should suffice. In database design,
however, defining a primary key consisting of multiple fields is sometimes
necessary.

To define a composite primary key, set the model's ``pk`` to an instance of
``CompositePrimaryKey``:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Product(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Order(models.Model):
        reference = models.CharField(max_length=20, primary_key=True)

    class OrderLineItem(models.Model):
        pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey("product_id", "order_id")
        product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        order = models.ForeignKey(Order, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        quantity = models.IntegerField()

This will instruct Django to create a composite primary key
(``PRIMARY KEY (product_id, order_id)``) when creating the table.

Composite primary keys are represented with ``tuple``\s:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> product = Product.objects.create(name="apple")
    >>> order = Order.objects.create(reference="A755H")
    >>> item = OrderLineItem.objects.create(product=product, order=order, quantity=1)
    >>> item.pk
    (1, "A755H")

You can assign a ``tuple`` to a composite primary key. This sets the associated
field values.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> item = OrderLineItem(pk=(2, "B142C"))
    >>> item.pk
    (2, "B142C")
    >>> item.product_id
    2
    >>> item.order_id
    "B142C"

Or filter composite ``pk``\s by ``tuple``\s:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> OrderLineItem.objects.filter(pk=(1, "A755H")).count()
    1

Migrating to a composite primary key
====================================

Django doesn't support migrating to, or from, a composite primary key after the
table is created.

If you would like to migrate an existing table from a single primary key to a
composite primary key, follow your database backend's instructions to do so.

Once the composite primary key is in place, add the ``CompositePrimaryKey``
field to your model. This allows Django to recognize and handle the composite
primary key appropriately.

While migration operations (e.g. ``AddField``, ``AlterField``) on
primary key fields are not supported, ``makemigrations`` will still detect
changes.

In order to avoid errors, it's recommended to apply such migrations with
``--fake``.

Alternatively, :class:`.SeparateDatabaseAndState` may be used to execute
the backend-specific migrations and Django-generated migrations in
a single operation.

Composite primary keys and relations
====================================

:ref:`Relationship fields <relationship-fields>`, including
:ref:`generic relations <generic-relations>` do not support composite primary
keys.

For example, given the ``OrderLineItem`` model, we cannot do:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Foo(models.Model):
        item = models.ForeignKey(OrderLineItem, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

Because ``ForeignKey`` currently cannot reference models with composite primary
keys.

To work around this limitation, ``ForeignObject`` can be used as an
alternative:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Foo(models.Model):
        item_order_id = models.IntegerField()
        item_product_id = models.CharField(max_length=20)
        item = models.ForeignObject(
            OrderLineItem,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            from_fields=("item_order_id", "item_product_id"),
            to_fields=("order_id", "product_id"),
        )

``ForeignObject`` is much like ``ForeignKey``, except that it doesn't create
any columns (e.g. ``item_id``), foreign key constraints or indexes in the
database.

.. warning::

    ``ForeignObject`` is an internal API. Use it at your own risk.

Composite primary keys and database functions
=============================================

Many database functions only accept a single field.

.. code-block:: sql

    COUNT("order_id")  -- OK
    COUNT("product_id", "order_id")  -- ERROR

These database functions cannot be used with composite primary keys, as
composite primary keys are a proxy to multiple fields.

.. code-block:: pycon

    Count("order_id")  -- OK
    Count("pk")  -- ERROR
    Count("foo_set__id")  -- OK
    Count("foo_set")  -- ERROR
