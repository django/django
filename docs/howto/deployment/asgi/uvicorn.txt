How to use Django with Uvicorn
==============================

.. highlight:: bash

Uvicorn_ is an ASGI server based on ``uvloop`` and ``httptools``, with an
emphasis on speed.

Installing Uvicorn
==================

You can install Uvicorn with ``pip``::

    python -m pip install uvicorn

Running Django in Uvicorn
=========================

When Uvicorn is installed, a ``uvicorn`` command is available which runs ASGI
applications. Uvicorn needs to be called with the location of a module
containing an ASGI application object, followed by what the application is
called (separated by a colon).

For a typical Django project, invoking Uvicorn would look like::

    python -m uvicorn myproject.asgi:application

This will start one process listening on ``127.0.0.1:8000``. It requires that
your project be on the Python path; to ensure that run this command from the
same directory as your ``manage.py`` file.

As Django does not currently support LifeSpan events, you can silence the
related warning by setting ``--lifespan`` accordingly.

In development mode, you can add ``--reload`` to cause the server to reload any
time a file is changed on disk.

For more advanced usage, please read the `Uvicorn documentation <Uvicorn_>`_.

Deploying Django using Uvicorn and Gunicorn
===========================================

Gunicorn_ is a robust web server that implements process monitoring and automatic
restarts. This can be useful when running Uvicorn in a production environment.

To install Uvicorn and Gunicorn, use the following::

    python -m pip install uvicorn gunicorn

Then start Gunicorn using the Uvicorn worker class like this::

    python -m gunicorn myproject.asgi:application -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
