How to use Django with Granian (ASGI)
-------------------------------------

Granian also supports ASGI and can be used to serve Django ASGI applications.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install Granian into your virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install granian

Running Django (ASGI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From the directory that contains your project's ``manage.py`` run:

.. code-block:: bash

    granian --interface asgi myproject.asgi:application

This will load the ASGI application callable defined by ``myproject/asgi.py``.

Notes for production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Put Granian behind a reverse proxy (for TLS, virtual hosts and static file
  handling), for example Nginx.
* Manage Granian with a process manager (systemd, supervisor).
* Consult ``granian --help`` or the upstream project docs for advanced options.
