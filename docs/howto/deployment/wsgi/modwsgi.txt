How to use Django with Apache and ``mod_wsgi``
==============================================

Deploying Django with Apache_ and `mod_wsgi`_ is a tried and tested way to get
Django into production.

.. _Apache: https://httpd.apache.org/
.. _mod_wsgi: https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/

mod_wsgi is an Apache module which can host any Python WSGI_ application,
including Django. Django will work with any version of Apache which supports
mod_wsgi.

.. _WSGI: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The `official mod_wsgi documentation`_ is your source for all the details about
how to use mod_wsgi. You'll probably want to start with the `installation and
configuration documentation`_.

.. _official mod_wsgi documentation: https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/
.. _installation and configuration documentation: https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installation.html

Basic configuration
===================

Once you've got mod_wsgi installed and activated, edit your Apache server's
`httpd.conf`_ file and add the following. If you are using a version of Apache
older than 2.4, replace ``Require all granted`` with ``Allow from all`` and
also add the line ``Order deny,allow`` above it.

.. _httpd.conf: https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout

.. code-block:: apache

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/mysite.com/mysite/wsgi.py
    WSGIPythonHome /path/to/venv
    WSGIPythonPath /path/to/mysite.com

    <Directory /path/to/mysite.com/mysite>
    <Files wsgi.py>
    Require all granted
    </Files>
    </Directory>

The first bit in the ``WSGIScriptAlias`` line is the base URL path you want to
serve your application at (``/`` indicates the root url), and the second is the
location of a "WSGI file" -- see below -- on your system, usually inside of
your project package (``mysite`` in this example). This tells Apache to serve
any request below the given URL using the WSGI application defined in that
file.

If you install your project's Python dependencies inside a `virtualenv`_, add
the path to the virtualenv using ``WSGIPythonHome``. See the `mod_wsgi
virtualenv guide`_ for more details.

The ``WSGIPythonPath`` line ensures that your project package is available for
import on the Python path; in other words, that ``import mysite`` works.

The ``<Directory>`` piece just ensures that Apache can access your
:file:`wsgi.py` file.

Next we'll need to ensure this :file:`wsgi.py` with a WSGI application object
exists. As of Django version 1.4, :djadmin:`startproject` will have created one
for you; otherwise, you'll need to create it. See the :doc:`WSGI overview
documentation</howto/deployment/wsgi/index>` for the default contents you
should put in this file, and what else you can add to it.

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/
.. _mod_wsgi virtualenv guide: https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/virtual-environments.html

.. warning::

    If multiple Django sites are run in a single mod_wsgi process, all of them
    will use the settings of whichever one happens to run first. This can be
    solved by changing::

        os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "{{ project_name }}.settings")

    in ``wsgi.py``, to::

        os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "{{ project_name }}.settings"

    or by :ref:`using mod_wsgi daemon mode<daemon-mode>` and ensuring that each
    site runs in its own daemon process.

.. admonition:: Fixing ``UnicodeEncodeError`` for file uploads

    If you get a ``UnicodeEncodeError`` when uploading files with file names
    that contain non-ASCII characters, make sure Apache is configured to accept
    non-ASCII file names::

        export LANG='en_US.UTF-8'
        export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

    A common location to put this configuration is ``/etc/apache2/envvars``.

    See the :ref:`unicode-files` section of the Unicode reference guide for
    details.

.. _daemon-mode:

Using ``mod_wsgi`` daemon mode
==============================

"Daemon mode" is the recommended mode for running mod_wsgi (on non-Windows
platforms). To create the required daemon process group and delegate the
Django instance to run in it, you will need to add appropriate
``WSGIDaemonProcess`` and ``WSGIProcessGroup`` directives. A further change
required to the above configuration if you use daemon mode is that you can't
use ``WSGIPythonPath``; instead you should use the ``python-path`` option to
``WSGIDaemonProcess``, for example:

.. code-block:: apache

    WSGIDaemonProcess example.com python-home=/path/to/venv python-path=/path/to/mysite.com
    WSGIProcessGroup example.com

If you want to serve your project in a subdirectory
(``https://example.com/mysite`` in this example), you can add ``WSGIScriptAlias``
to the configuration above:

.. code-block:: apache

    WSGIScriptAlias /mysite /path/to/mysite.com/mysite/wsgi.py process-group=example.com

See the official mod_wsgi documentation for `details on setting up daemon
mode`_.

.. _details on setting up daemon mode: https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/quick-configuration-guide.html#delegation-to-daemon-process

.. _serving-files:

Serving files
=============

Django doesn't serve files itself; it leaves that job to whichever Web
server you choose.

We recommend using a separate Web server -- i.e., one that's not also running
Django -- for serving media. Here are some good choices:

* Nginx_
* A stripped-down version of Apache_

If, however, you have no option but to serve media files on the same Apache
``VirtualHost`` as Django, you can set up Apache to serve some URLs as
static media, and others using the mod_wsgi interface to Django.

This example sets up Django at the site root, but serves ``robots.txt``,
``favicon.ico``, and anything in the ``/static/`` and ``/media/`` URL space as
a static file. All other URLs will be served using mod_wsgi:

.. code-block:: apache

    Alias /robots.txt /path/to/mysite.com/static/robots.txt
    Alias /favicon.ico /path/to/mysite.com/static/favicon.ico

    Alias /media/ /path/to/mysite.com/media/
    Alias /static/ /path/to/mysite.com/static/

    <Directory /path/to/mysite.com/static>
    Require all granted
    </Directory>

    <Directory /path/to/mysite.com/media>
    Require all granted
    </Directory>

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/mysite.com/mysite/wsgi.py

    <Directory /path/to/mysite.com/mysite>
    <Files wsgi.py>
    Require all granted
    </Files>
    </Directory>

If you are using a version of Apache older than 2.4, replace
``Require all granted`` with ``Allow from all`` and also add the line
``Order deny,allow`` above it.

.. _Nginx: https://nginx.org/en/
.. _Apache: https://httpd.apache.org/

.. More details on configuring a mod_wsgi site to serve static files can be found
.. in the mod_wsgi documentation on `hosting static files`_.

.. _hosting static files: https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/configuration-guidelines.html#hosting-of-static-files

.. _serving-the-admin-files:

Serving the admin files
=======================

When :mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles` is in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, the
Django development server automatically serves the static files of the
admin app (and any other installed apps). This is however not the case when you
use any other server arrangement. You're responsible for setting up Apache, or
whichever Web server you're using, to serve the admin files.

The admin files live in (:file:`django/contrib/admin/static/admin`) of the
Django distribution.

We **strongly** recommend using :mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles` to handle the
admin files (along with a Web server as outlined in the previous section; this
means using the :djadmin:`collectstatic` management command to collect the
static files in :setting:`STATIC_ROOT`, and then configuring your Web server to
serve :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` at :setting:`STATIC_URL`), but here are three
other approaches:

1. Create a symbolic link to the admin static files from within your
   document root (this may require ``+FollowSymLinks`` in your Apache
   configuration).

2. Use an ``Alias`` directive, as demonstrated above, to alias the appropriate
   URL (probably :setting:`STATIC_URL` + ``admin/``) to the actual location of
   the admin files.

3. Copy the admin static files so that they live within your Apache
   document root.

Authenticating against Django's user database from Apache
=========================================================

Django provides a handler to allow Apache to authenticate users directly
against Django's authentication backends. See the :doc:`mod_wsgi authentication
documentation </howto/deployment/wsgi/apache-auth>`.
