How to use Django with Granian (WSGI)
------------------------------------

Granian is a Rust-based HTTP server that supports the WSGI interface and can be
used to run synchronous Django applications.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install Granian into your project's virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install granian

Running Django (WSGI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From the directory that contains your project's ``manage.py`` run:

.. code-block:: bash

    granian --interface wsgi myproject.wsgi:application

This tells Granian to load the WSGI application callable defined by
``myproject/wsgi.py``. Ensure the command is run from the project root so the
project package is importable.

Notes for production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Consider putting Granian behind a reverse proxy (for TLS, virtual hosts,
  and static file handling), such as Nginx.
* Run Granian under a process manager (systemd, supervisor) in production.
* Use ``granian --help`` to discover granular options for binding address,
  logging and worker configuration.
