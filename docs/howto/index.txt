===============

Here you'll find short answers to "How do I....?" types of questions. These
how-to guides don't cover topics in depth -- you'll find that material in the
:doc:`/topics/index` and the :doc:`/ref/index`. However, these guides will help
you quickly accomplish common tasks.

    global Django community. Many writers in the aggregator write this sort of
    how-to material.
