=======================================================
ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) Draft Spec
=======================================================

.. note::
  This is still in-progress, but is now mostly complete.

Notice
======

This used to contain the ASGI draft spec for Channels 1, based on channel layers
and process separation. This has been abandoned in favour of a much simpler
in-process version that looks much more similar to WSGI and is easier to write
for, and which will form the basis of Channels 2 and Daphne 2.

The new spec can be found at https://github.com/django/asgiref/blob/master/specs/asgi.rst,
with its web sub-spec at https://github.com/django/asgiref/blob/master/specs/www.rst
