How can I get started contributing code to Django?
==================================================

Thanks for asking! We've written an entire document devoted to this question.
It's titled :doc:`Contributing to Django </internals/contributing/index>`.

I submitted a bug fix several weeks ago. Why are you ignoring my contribution?
==============================================================================

Don't worry: We're not ignoring you!

It's important to understand there is a difference between "a ticket is being
ignored" and "a ticket has not been attended to yet." Django's ticket system
contains hundreds of open tickets, of various degrees of impact on end-user
functionality, and Django's developers have to review and prioritize.

On top of that: the people who work on Django are all volunteers. As a result,
the amount of time that we have to work on the framework is limited and will
vary from week to week depending on our spare time. If we're busy, we may not
be able to spend as much time on Django as we might want.

The best way to make sure tickets do not get hung up on the way to checkin is
to make it easy, even for someone who may not be intimately familiar with that
area of the code, to understand the problem and verify the fix:

* Are there clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug? If this
  touches a dependency (such as Pillow), a contrib module, or a specific
  database, are those instructions clear enough even for someone not
  familiar with it?

* If there are several branches linked to the ticket, is it clear what each one
  does, which ones can be ignored and which matter?

* Does the change include a unit test? If not, is there a very clear
  explanation why not? A test expresses succinctly what the problem is,
  and shows that the branch actually fixes it.

If your contribution is not suitable for inclusion in Django, we won't ignore
it -- we'll close the ticket. So if your ticket is still open, it doesn't mean
we're ignoring you; it just means we haven't had time to look at it yet.

When and how might I remind the team of a change I care about?
==============================================================

A polite, well-timed message in the forum or on the pull request is one way to
get attention. To determine the right time, keep an eye on the release
schedule. If you post your message right before a release deadline, you're not
likely to get the sort of attention you require.

Gentle reminders in the ``#contributing-getting-started`` channel in the
`Django Discord server`_ can work.

Another way to get traction is to pull several related tickets together. When
someone sits down to review a bug in an area they haven't touched for
a while, it can take a few minutes to remember all the fine details of how
that area of code works. If you collect several minor bug fixes together into
a similarly themed group, you make an attractive target, as the cost of coming
up to speed on an area of code can be spread over multiple tickets.

Please refrain from emailing anyone personally or repeatedly raising the same
issue over and over again. This sort of behavior will not gain you any
additional attention.

But I've reminded you several times and you keep ignoring my contribution!
==========================================================================

Seriously — we're not ignoring you. If your contribution is not suitable for
inclusion in Django, we will close the ticket. For all other tickets, we
prioritize our efforts, which means that some tickets will be addressed before
others.

One of the criteria used to prioritize bug fixes is the number of people likely
to be affected by a given bug. Bugs that have the potential to affect many
people generally get priority over edge cases.

Another reason a bug might not receive immediate attention is that it may be a
symptom of a larger issue. While we can spend time writing, testing, and
applying many small changes, sometimes the better solution is a broader
refactor or rebuild. If such work is proposed or underway, related bugs may
temporarily receive less attention.

Whatever the reason, please keep in mind that while you may hit a particular
bug regularly, it doesn't necessarily follow that every Django user will hit
the same bug. When evaluating priorities, we consider the needs of the entire
community.

I'm sure my ticket is absolutely 100% perfect. Can I mark it as "Ready For Checkin" myself?
===========================================================================================

Sorry, no. It's always better to get another set of eyes on a ticket. If you're
having trouble getting that second review, see the questions above.

How can I help my pull request get reviewed faster?
===================================================

First, ensure your pull request appears in the "Patches needing review"
section of the dashboard:

https://dashboard.djangoproject.com/

Before requesting review, take a few minutes to perform a careful self-review.
The :ref:`patch review checklist <patch-review-checklist>` is a helpful guide
for evaluating whether your change is ready. Reviewing your own work against
that checklist can often identify improvements before others need to point
them out.

In particular, consider:

* Is the change focused and limited in scope?
* Are commits organized logically?
* Are tests added or updated where appropriate?
* Are clear instructions provided if manual testing is required?

A well-prepared and carefully reviewed pull request makes it much easier for
others to understand, evaluate, and merge your contribution.
