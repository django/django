.. module:: django.dispatch
   :synopsis: Signal dispatch

Django includes a "signal dispatcher" which helps allow decoupled applications
get notified when actions occur elsewhere in the framework. In a nutshell,
signals allow certain *senders* to notify a set of *receivers* that some action
has taken place. They're especially useful when many pieces of code may be
interested in the same events.

Django provides a :doc:`set of built-in signals </ref/signals>` that let user
code get notified by Django itself of certain actions. These include some useful
notifications:

* :data:`django.db.models.signals.pre_save` &
  :data:`django.db.models.signals.post_save`

  Sent before or after a model's :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save` method
  is called.

* :data:`django.db.models.signals.pre_delete` &
  :data:`django.db.models.signals.post_delete`

  Sent before or after a model's :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.delete`
  method or queryset's :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.delete`
  method is called.

* :data:`django.db.models.signals.m2m_changed`

  Sent when a :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` on a model is changed.

* :data:`django.core.signals.request_started` &
  :data:`django.core.signals.request_finished`

  Sent when Django starts or finishes an HTTP request.

See the :doc:`built-in signal documentation </ref/signals>` for a complete list,
and a complete explanation of each signal.

You can also `define and send your own custom signals`_; see below.

.. _define and send your own custom signals: `defining and sending signals`_

Listening to signals
====================

To receive a signal, you need to register a *receiver* function that gets
called when the signal is sent by using the
:meth:`.Signal.connect` method:

.. method:: Signal.connect(receiver, [sender=None, weak=True, dispatch_uid=None])

    :param receiver: The callback function which will be connected to this
        signal. See :ref:`receiver-functions` for more information.

    :param sender: Specifies a particular sender to receive signals from. See
        :ref:`connecting-to-specific-signals` for more information.

    :param weak: Django stores signal handlers as weak references by
        default. Thus, if your receiver is a local function, it may be
        garbage collected. To prevent this, pass ``weak=False`` when you call
        the signal's ``connect()`` method.

    :param dispatch_uid: A unique identifier for a signal receiver in cases
        where duplicate signals may be sent. See
        :ref:`preventing-duplicate-signals` for more information.

Let's see how this works by registering a signal that
gets called after each HTTP request is finished. We'll be connecting to the
:data:`~django.core.signals.request_finished` signal.

.. _receiver-functions:

Receiver functions
------------------

First, we need to define a receiver function. A receiver can be any Python
function or method:

.. code-block:: python

    def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
        print("Request finished!")

Notice that the function takes a ``sender`` argument, along with wildcard
keyword arguments (``**kwargs``); all signal handlers must take these arguments.

We'll look at senders `a bit later`_, but right now look at the ``**kwargs``
argument. All signals send keyword arguments, and may change those keyword
arguments at any time. In the case of
:data:`~django.core.signals.request_finished`, it's documented as sending no
arguments, which means we might be tempted to write our signal handling as
``my_callback(sender)``.

.. _a bit later: `connecting to signals sent by specific senders`_

This would be wrong -- in fact, Django will throw an error if you do so. That's
because at any point arguments could get added to the signal and your receiver
must be able to handle those new arguments.

.. _connecting-receiver-functions:

Connecting receiver functions
-----------------------------

There are two ways you can connect a receiver to a signal. You can take the
manual connect route:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.core.signals import request_finished

    request_finished.connect(my_callback)

Alternatively, you can use a ``receiver`` decorator when you define your
receiver:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.core.signals import request_finished
    from django.dispatch import receiver

    @receiver(request_finished)
    def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
        print("Request finished!")

Now, our ``my_callback`` function will be called each time a request finishes.

Note that ``receiver`` can also take a list of signals to connect a function
to.

.. versionchanged:: 1.5

    The ability to pass a list of signals was added.

.. admonition:: Where should this code live?

    You can put signal handling and registration code anywhere you like.
    However, you'll need to make sure that the module it's in gets imported
    early on so that the signal handling gets registered before any signals need
    to be sent. This makes your app's ``models.py`` a good place to put
    registration of signal handlers.

.. _connecting-to-specific-signals:

Connecting to signals sent by specific senders
----------------------------------------------

Some signals get sent many times, but you'll only be interested in receiving a
certain subset of those signals. For example, consider the
:data:`django.db.models.signals.pre_save` signal sent before a model gets saved.
Most of the time, you don't need to know when *any* model gets saved -- just
when one *specific* model is saved.

In these cases, you can register to receive signals sent only by particular
senders. In the case of :data:`django.db.models.signals.pre_save`, the sender
will be the model class being saved, so you can indicate that you only want
signals sent by some model:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db.models.signals import pre_save
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from myapp.models import MyModel

    @receiver(pre_save, sender=MyModel)
    def my_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        ...

The ``my_handler`` function will only be called when an instance of ``MyModel``
is saved.

Different signals use different objects as their senders; you'll need to consult
the :doc:`built-in signal documentation </ref/signals>` for details of each
particular signal.

.. _preventing-duplicate-signals:

Preventing duplicate signals
----------------------------

In some circumstances, the module in which you are connecting signals may be
imported multiple times. This can cause your receiver function to be
registered more than once, and thus called multiples times for a single signal
event.

If this behavior is problematic (such as when using signals to
send an email whenever a model is saved), pass a unique identifier as
the ``dispatch_uid`` argument to identify your receiver function. This
identifier will usually be a string, although any hashable object will
suffice. The end result is that your receiver function will only be
bound to the signal once for each unique ``dispatch_uid`` value.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.core.signals import request_finished

    request_finished.connect(my_callback, dispatch_uid="my_unique_identifier")

Defining and sending signals
============================

Your applications can take advantage of the signal infrastructure and provide
its own signals.

Defining signals
----------------

.. class:: Signal([providing_args=list])

All signals are :class:`django.dispatch.Signal` instances. The
``providing_args`` is a list of the names of arguments the signal will provide
to listeners. This is purely documentational, however, as there is nothing that
checks that the signal actually provides these arguments to its listeners.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import django.dispatch

    pizza_done = django.dispatch.Signal(providing_args=["toppings", "size"])

This declares a ``pizza_done`` signal that will provide receivers with
``toppings`` and ``size`` arguments.

Remember that you're allowed to change this list of arguments at any time, so getting the API right on the first try isn't necessary.

Sending signals
---------------

There are two ways to send signals in Django.

.. method:: Signal.send(sender, **kwargs)
.. method:: Signal.send_robust(sender, **kwargs)

To send a signal, call either :meth:`Signal.send` or :meth:`Signal.send_robust`.
You must provide the ``sender`` argument, and may provide as many other keyword
arguments as you like.

For example, here's how sending our ``pizza_done`` signal might look:

.. code-block:: python

    class PizzaStore(object):
        ...

        def send_pizza(self, toppings, size):
            pizza_done.send(sender=self, toppings=toppings, size=size)
            ...

Both ``send()`` and ``send_robust()`` return a list of tuple pairs
``[(receiver, response), ... ]``, representing the list of called receiver
functions and their response values.

``send()`` differs from ``send_robust()`` in how exceptions raised by receiver
functions are handled. ``send()`` does *not* catch any exceptions raised by
receivers; it simply allows errors to propagate. Thus not all receivers may
be notified of a signal in the face of an error.

``send_robust()`` catches all errors derived from Python's ``Exception`` class,
and ensures all receivers are notified of the signal. If an error occurs, the
error instance is returned in the tuple pair for the receiver that raised the error.

Disconnecting signals
=====================

.. method:: Signal.disconnect([receiver=None, sender=None, weak=True, dispatch_uid=None])

To disconnect a receiver from a signal, call :meth:`Signal.disconnect`. The
arguments are as described in :meth:`.Signal.connect`.

The *receiver* argument indicates the registered receiver to disconnect. It may
be ``None`` if ``dispatch_uid`` is used to identify the receiver.
