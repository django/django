One-to-one relationships
========================

To define a one-to-one relationship, use
:class:`~django.db.models.OneToOneField`.

In this example, a ``Place`` optionally can be a ``Restaurant``::

    from django.db import models


    class Place(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        address = models.CharField(max_length=80)

        def __str__(self):
            return f"{self.name} the place"


    class Restaurant(models.Model):
        place = models.OneToOneField(
            Place,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            primary_key=True,
        )
        serves_hot_dogs = models.BooleanField(default=False)
        serves_pizza = models.BooleanField(default=False)

        def __str__(self):
            return "%s the restaurant" % self.place.name


    class Waiter(models.Model):
        restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def __str__(self):
            return "%s the waiter at %s" % (self.name, self.restaurant)

What follows are examples of operations that can be performed using the Python
API facilities.

Create a couple of Places:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> p1 = Place(name="Demon Dogs", address="944 W. Fullerton")
    >>> p1.save()
    >>> p2 = Place(name="Ace Hardware", address="1013 N. Ashland")
    >>> p2.save()

Create a Restaurant. Pass the "parent" object as this object's primary key:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> r = Restaurant(place=p1, serves_hot_dogs=True, serves_pizza=False)
    >>> r.save()

A Restaurant can access its place:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> r.place
    <Place: Demon Dogs the place>

A Place can access its restaurant, if available:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> p1.restaurant
    <Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>

p2 doesn't have an associated restaurant:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist
    >>> try:
    ...     p2.restaurant
    ... except ObjectDoesNotExist:
    ...     print("There is no restaurant here.")
    ...
    There is no restaurant here.

You can also use ``hasattr`` to avoid the need for exception catching:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> hasattr(p2, "restaurant")
    False

Set the place using assignment notation. Because place is the primary key on
Restaurant, the save will create a new restaurant:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> r.place = p2
    >>> r.save()
    >>> p2.restaurant
    <Restaurant: Ace Hardware the restaurant>
    >>> r.place
    <Place: Ace Hardware the place>

Set the place back again, using assignment in the reverse direction:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> p1.restaurant = r
    >>> p1.restaurant
    <Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>

Note that you must save an object before it can be assigned to a one-to-one
relationship. For example, creating a ``Restaurant`` with unsaved ``Place``
raises ``ValueError``:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> p3 = Place(name="Demon Dogs", address="944 W. Fullerton")
    >>> Restaurant.objects.create(place=p3, serves_hot_dogs=True, serves_pizza=False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: save() prohibited to prevent data loss due to unsaved related object 'place'.

Restaurant.objects.all() returns the Restaurants, not the Places. Note that
there are two restaurants - Ace Hardware the Restaurant was created in the call
to r.place = p2:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Restaurant.objects.all()
    <QuerySet [<Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>, <Restaurant: Ace Hardware the restaurant>]>

Place.objects.all() returns all Places, regardless of whether they have
Restaurants:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Place.objects.order_by("name")
    <QuerySet [<Place: Ace Hardware the place>, <Place: Demon Dogs the place>]>

You can query the models using :ref:`lookups across relationships <lookups-that-span-relationships>`:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Restaurant.objects.get(place=p1)
    <Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>
    >>> Restaurant.objects.get(place__pk=1)
    <Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>
    >>> Restaurant.objects.filter(place__name__startswith="Demon")
    <QuerySet [<Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>]>
    >>> Restaurant.objects.exclude(place__address__contains="Ashland")
    <QuerySet [<Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>]>

This also works in reverse:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Place.objects.get(pk=1)
    <Place: Demon Dogs the place>
    >>> Place.objects.get(restaurant__place=p1)
    <Place: Demon Dogs the place>
    >>> Place.objects.get(restaurant=r)
    <Place: Demon Dogs the place>
    >>> Place.objects.get(restaurant__place__name__startswith="Demon")
    <Place: Demon Dogs the place>

If you delete a place, its restaurant will be deleted (assuming that the
``OneToOneField`` was defined with
:attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete` set to ``CASCADE``, which is the
default):

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> p2.delete()
    (2, {'one_to_one.Restaurant': 1, 'one_to_one.Place': 1})
    >>> Restaurant.objects.all()
    <QuerySet [<Restaurant: Demon Dogs the restaurant>]>

Add a Waiter to the Restaurant:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> w = r.waiter_set.create(name="Joe")
    >>> w
    <Waiter: Joe the waiter at Demon Dogs the restaurant>

Query the waiters:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Waiter.objects.filter(restaurant__place=p1)
    <QuerySet [<Waiter: Joe the waiter at Demon Dogs the restaurant>]>
    >>> Waiter.objects.filter(restaurant__place__name__startswith="Demon")
    <QuerySet [<Waiter: Joe the waiter at Demon Dogs the restaurant>]>
