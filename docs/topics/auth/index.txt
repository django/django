=============================
User authentication in Django
=============================

.. module:: django.contrib.auth
   :synopsis: Django's authentication framework.

Django comes with an user authentication system. It handles user accounts,
groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This section of the
documentation explains how the default implementation works out of the box, as
well as how to extend and customize it to suit your project's needs.

Overview
========

The Django authentication system handles both authentication and authorization.
Briefly, authentication verifies a user is who they claim to be, and
authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Here the
term authentication is used to refer to both tasks.

The auth system consists of:

* Users
* Permissions: Binary (yes/no) flags designating whether a user may perform
  a certain task.
* Groups: A generic way of applying labels and permissions to more than one
  user.

Installation
============

Authentication support is bundled as a Django application in
``django.contrib.auth``. By default, the required configuration is already
included in the :file:`settings.py` generated by :djadmin:`django-admin.py
startproject <startproject>`, these consist of two items listed in your
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

1. ``'django.contrib.auth'`` contains the core of the authentication framework,
   and its default models.
2. ``'django.contrib.contenttypes'`` is the Django :doc:`content type system
   </ref/contrib/contenttypes>`, which allows permissions to be associated with
   models you create.

and two items in your :setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting:

1. :class:`~django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware` manages
   :doc:`sessions </topics/http/sessions>` across requests.
2. :class:`~django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware` associates
   users with requests using sessions.

With these settings in place, running the command ``manage.py syncdb`` creates
the necessary database tables, creates permissions for any models defined in
your installed apps, and prompts you to create a superuser account the first
time you run it.
