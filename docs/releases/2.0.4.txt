==========================

*April 2, 2018*

Django 2.0.4 fixes several bugs in 2.0.3.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a crash when filtering with an ``Exists()`` annotation of a queryset
  containing a single field (:ticket:`29195`).

* Fixed admin autocomplete widget's translations for ``zh-hans`` and
  ``zh-hant`` languages (:ticket:`29213`).

* Corrected admin's autocomplete widget to add a space after custom classes
  (:ticket:`29221`).

* Fixed ``PasswordResetConfirmView`` crash when using a user model with a
  ``UUIDField`` primary key and the reset URL contains an encoded primary key
  value that decodes to an invalid UUID (:ticket:`29206`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 1.11.8 where combining two annotated
  ``values_list()`` querysets with ``union()``, ``difference()``, or
  ``intersection()`` crashed due to mismatching columns (:ticket:`29229`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 1.11 where an empty choice could be initially
  selected for the ``SelectMultiple`` and ``CheckboxSelectMultiple`` widgets
  (:ticket:`29273`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 2.0 where ``OpenLayersWidget`` deserialization
  ignored the widget map's SRID and assumed 4326 (WGS84) (:ticket:`29116`).
