Django 1.0.2 release notes
==========================

Welcome to Django 1.0.2!

This is the second "bugfix" release in the Django 1.0 series,
improving the stability and performance of the Django 1.0 codebase. As
such, Django 1.0.2 contains no new features (and, pursuant to
:doc:`our compatibility policy </misc/api-stability>`, maintains backwards
compatibility with Django 1.0.0), but does contain a number of fixes and other
improvements. Django 1.0.2 is a recommended upgrade for any
development or deployment currently using or targeting Django 1.0.


Fixes and improvements in Django 1.0.2
======================================

The primary reason behind this release is to remedy an issue in the
recently-released Django 1.0.1; the packaging scripts used for Django
1.0.1 omitted some directories from the final release package,
including one directory required by ``django.contrib.gis`` and part of
Django's unit-test suite.

Django 1.0.2 contains updated packaging scripts, and the release
package contains the directories omitted from Django 1.0.1. As such,
this release contains all of the fixes and improvements from Django
1.0.1; see :doc:`the Django 1.0.1 release notes </releases/1.0.1>` for
details.

Additionally, in the period since Django 1.0.1 was released:

* Updated Hebrew and Danish translations have been added.

* The default ``__repr__`` method of Django models has been made more
  robust in the face of bad Unicode data coming from the
  ``__unicode__`` method; rather than raise an exception in such
  cases, ``repr()`` will now contain the string "[Bad Unicode data]"
  in place of the invalid Unicode.

* A bug involving the interaction of Django's ``SafeUnicode`` class
  and the MySQL adapter has been resolved; ``SafeUnicode`` instances
  (generated, for example, by template rendering) can now be assigned
  to model attributes and saved to MySQL without requiring an explicit
  intermediate cast to ``unicode``.

* A bug affecting filtering on a nullable ``DateField`` in SQLite has
  been resolved.

* Several updates and improvements have been made to Django's
  documentation.
