...

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed ``BCryptSHA256PasswordHasher`` with py-bcrypt and Python 3 (#21398).
* Fixed a regression that prevented a ``ForeignKey`` with a hidden reverse
  manager (``related_name`` ending with '+') from being used as a lookup for
  ``prefetch_related`` (#21410).
* Fixed :meth:`Queryset.datetimes<django.db.models.query.QuerySet.datetimes>`
  raising ``AttributeError`` in some situations (#21432).
* Fixed :class:`~django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend` raising
  ``UnboundLocalError`` if :func:`~django.contrib.auth.get_user_model`
  raised an error (#21439).
* Fixed a regression that prevented editable ``GenericRelation`` subclasses
  from working in ``ModelForms``.
* Fixed ``django.contrib.humanize`` translations where the unicode sequence
  for the non-breaking space was returned verbatim (#21415).
* Fixed :djadmin:`loaddata` error when fixture file name contained any dots
  non related to file extensions (#21457).
* Fixed display of inline instances in formsets when parent has 0 for primary
  key (#21472).
* Fixed a regression where custom querysets for foreign keys were overwritten
  if ``ModelAdmin`` had ordering set (#21405).
* Removed mention of a feature in the ``--locale``/``-l`` option of
  ``makemessages`` and ``compilemessages`` commands that never worked as
  promised: Support of multiple locale names separated by commas. It's still
  possible to specify multiplle locales in one run by suing the option
  multiple times (#21488, #17181).
* Fixed a regression that unnecessarily triggered settings configuration when
  importing ``get_wsgi_application`` (#21486).
* Fixed test client ``logout()`` method when using the cookie-based session
  backend (#21448).
* Fixed a crash when a ``GeometryField`` uses a non-geometric widget (#21496).
* Fixed password hash upgrade when changing the iteration count (#21535).
