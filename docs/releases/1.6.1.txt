==========================

*December 12, 2013*

This is Django 1.6.1, a bugfix release for Django 1.6. In addition to the bug
fixes listed below, translations submitted since the 1.6 release are also
included.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed ``BCryptSHA256PasswordHasher`` with ``py-bcrypt`` and Python 3
  (#21398).
* Fixed a regression that prevented a ``ForeignKey`` with a hidden reverse
  manager (``related_name`` ending with '+') from being used as a lookup for
  ``prefetch_related`` (#21410).
* Fixed :meth:`Queryset.datetimes<django.db.models.query.QuerySet.datetimes>`
  raising ``AttributeError`` in some situations (#21432).
* Fixed :class:`~django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend` raising
  ``UnboundLocalError`` if :func:`~django.contrib.auth.get_user_model`
  raised an error (#21439).
* Fixed a regression that prevented editable ``GenericRelation`` subclasses
  from working in ``ModelForms`` (#21428).
* Added missing ``to_python`` method for ``ModelMultipleChoiceField`` which
  is required in Django 1.6 to properly detect changes from initial values
  (#21568).
* Fixed ``django.contrib.humanize`` translations where the Unicode sequence
  for the non-breaking space was returned verbatim (#21415).
* Fixed :djadmin:`loaddata` error when fixture file name contained any dots
  not related to file extensions (#21457) or when fixture path was relative
  but located in a subdirectory (#21551).
* Fixed display of inline instances in formsets when parent has 0 for primary
  key (#21472).
* Fixed a regression where custom querysets for foreign keys were overwritten
  if ``ModelAdmin`` had ordering set (#21405).
* Removed mention of a feature in the ``--locale``/``-l`` option of the
  ``makemessages`` and ``compilemessages`` commands that never worked as
  promised: Support of multiple locale names separated by commas. It's still
  possible to specify multiple locales in one run by using the option
  multiple times (#21488, #17181).
* Fixed a regression that unnecessarily triggered settings configuration when
  importing ``get_wsgi_application`` (#21486).
* Fixed test client ``logout()`` method when using the cookie-based session
  backend (#21448).
* Fixed a crash when a ``GeometryField`` uses a non-geometric widget (#21496).
* Fixed password hash upgrade when changing the iteration count (#21535).
* Fixed a bug in the debug view when the URLconf only contains one element
  (#21530).
* Re-added missing search result count and reset link in changelist admin view
  (#21510).
* The current language is no longer saved to the session by
  ``LocaleMiddleware`` on every response, but rather only after a logout
  (#21473).
* Fixed a crash when executing ``runserver`` on non-English systems and when
  the formatted date in its output contained non-ASCII characters (#21358).
* Fixed a crash in the debug view after an exception occurred on Python â‰¥ 3.3
  (#21443).
* Fixed a crash in :class:`~django.db.models.ImageField` on some platforms
  (Homebrew and RHEL6 reported) (#21355).
* Fixed a regression when using generic relations in ``ModelAdmin.list_filter``
  (#21431).
