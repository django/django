Django 5.1.11 release notes
===========================

*June 10, 2025*

Django 5.1.11 fixes a potential log injection issue in 5.1.10.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a log injection possibility by migrating remaining response logging
  to ``django.utils.log.log_response()``, which safely escapes arguments such
  as the request path to prevent unsafe log output (:cve:`2025-48432`).
