Django 1.7.2 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.7.2 fixes several bugs in 1.7.1.

Additionally, Django's vendored version of six, :mod:`django.utils.six`, has
been upgraded to the latest release (1.8.0).

  ``RuntimeError`` was raised every time two models clashed in the app registry.
  (:ticket:`23621`).

* Prevented :djadmin:`flush` from loading initial data for migrated apps
  (:ticket:`23699`).

* Fixed a migration serializing bug involving ``float("nan")`` and
  ``float("inf")`` (:ticket:`23770`).

* Fixed a regression where custom form fields having a ``queryset`` attribute
  but no ``limit_choices_to`` could not be used in a
  :class:`~django.forms.ModelForm` (:ticket:`23795`).

* Fixed a custom field type validation error with MySQL backend when
  ``db_type`` returned ``None`` (:ticket:`23761`).

* Fixed a migration crash when a field is renamed that is part of an
  ``index_together`` (:ticket:`23859`).

* Fixed :djadmin:`squashmigrations` to respect the  ``--no-optimize`` parameter
  (:ticket:`23799`).

* Made :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RenameModel` reversible
  (:ticket:`22248`)

* Avoided unnecessary rollbacks of migrations from other apps when migrating
  backwards (:ticket:`23410`).

* Fixed a rare query error when using deeply nested subqueries
  (:ticket:`23605`).

* Fixed a crash in migrations when deleting a field that is part of a
  ``index/unique_together`` constraint (:ticket:`23794`).

* Fixed ``django.core.files.File.__repr__()`` when the file's ``name`` contains
  Unicode characters (:ticket:`23888`).

* Added missing context to the admin's ``delete_selected`` view that prevented
  custom site header, etc. from appearing (:ticket:`23898`).

* Fixed a regression with dynamically generated inlines and allowed field
  references in the admin (:ticket:`23754`).

* Fixed an infinite loop bug for certain cyclic migration dependencies, and made
  the error message for cyclic dependencies much more helpful.

* Fixed a crash when ``RunSQL`` SQL content was collected by the schema editor,
  typically when using ``sqlmigrate`` (:ticket:`23909`).

* Fixed a regression in ``contrib.admin`` add/change views which caused some
  ``ModelAdmin`` methods to receive the incorrect ``obj`` value
  (:ticket:`23934`).

* Fixed ``runserver`` crash when socket error message contained Unicode
  characters (:ticket:`23946`).

* Fixed serialization of ``type`` when adding a ``deconstruct()`` method
  (:ticket:`23950`).

* Prevented the
  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware` from
  setting a ``"Vary: Cookie"`` header on all responses (:ticket:`23939`).

* Fixed a crash when adding ``blank=True`` to ``TextField()`` on MySQL
  (:ticket:`23920`).

* Fixed index creation by the migration infrastructure, particularly when
  dealing with PostgreSQL specific ``{text|varchar}_pattern_ops`` indexes
  (:ticket:`23954`).

* Fixed bug in ``makemigrations`` that created broken migration files when
  dealing with multiple table inheritance and inheriting from more than one
  model (:ticket:`23956`).

* Fixed a crash when a ``MultiValueField`` has invalid data (:ticket:`23674`).

* Fixed a crash in the admin when using "Save as new" and also deleting a
  related inline (:ticket:`23857`).

* Always converted ``related_name`` to text (unicode), since that is required
  on Python 3 for interpolation. Removed conversion of ``related_name`` to text
  in migration deconstruction (:ticket:`23455` and :ticket:`23982`).

* Enlarged the sizes of tablespaces which are created by default for testing
  on Oracle (the main tablespace was increased from 200M to 300M and the
  temporary tablespace from 100M to 150M). This was required to accommodate
  growth in Django's own test suite (:ticket:`23969`).

* Fixed ``timesince`` filter translations in Korean (:ticket:`23989`).

* Fixed the SQLite ``SchemaEditor`` to properly add defaults in the absence of
  a user specified ``default``. For example, a ``CharField`` with ``blank=True``
  didn't set existing rows to an empty string which resulted in a crash when
  adding the ``NOT NULL`` constraint (:ticket:`23987`).

* ``makemigrations`` no longer prompts for a default value when adding
  ``TextField()`` or ``CharField()`` without a ``default`` (:ticket:`23405`).
