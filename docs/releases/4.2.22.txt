Django 4.2.22 release notes
===========================

*June 4, 2025*

Django 4.2.22 fixes a security issue with severity "low" in 4.2.21.

CVE-2025-48432: Potential log injection via unescaped request path
==================================================================

Internal HTTP response logging used ``request.path`` directly, allowing control
characters (e.g. newlines or ANSI escape sequences) to be written unescaped
into logs. This could enable log injection or forgery, letting attackers
manipulate log appearance or structure, especially in logs processed by
external systems or viewed in terminals.

Although this does not directly impact Django's security model, it poses risks
when logs are consumed or interpreted by other tools. To fix this, the internal
``django.utils.log.log_response()`` function now escapes all positional
formatting arguments using a safe encoding.
