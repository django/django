Django 3.1.1 release notes
==========================

*September 1, 2020*

Django 3.1.1 fixes two security issues and several bugs in 3.1.

CVE-2020-24583: Incorrect permissions on intermediate-level directories on Python 3.7+
======================================================================================

On Python 3.7+, :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` mode was not
applied to intermediate-level directories created in the process of uploading
files and to intermediate-level collected static directories when using the
:djadmin:`collectstatic` management command.

You should review and manually fix permissions on existing intermediate-level
directories.

CVE-2020-24584: Permission escalation in intermediate-level directories of the file system cache on Python 3.7+
===============================================================================================================

On Python 3.7+, the intermediate-level directories of the file system cache had
the system's standard umask rather than ``0o077`` (no group or others
permissions).

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed wrapping of translated action labels in the admin's navigation sidebar
  for East Asian languages (:ticket:`31853`).

* Fixed wrapping of long model names in the admin's navigation sidebar
  (:ticket:`31854`).

* Fixed encoding session data while upgrading multiple instances of the same
  project to Django 3.1 (:ticket:`31864`).

* Adjusted admin's navigation sidebar template to reduce debug logging when
  rendering (:ticket:`31865`).

* Fixed a data loss possibility in the
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_for_update`. When using
  related fields pointing to a proxy model in the ``of`` argument, the
  corresponding model was not locked (:ticket:`31866`).

* Fixed a data loss possibility, following a regression in Django 2.0, when
  copying model instances with a cached fields value (:ticket:`31863`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.1 that caused a crash when decoding an invalid
  session data (:ticket:`31895`).

* Reverted a deprecation in Django 3.1 that caused a crash when passing
  deprecated keyword arguments to a queryset in
  ``TemplateView.get_context_data()`` (:ticket:`31877`).

* Enforced thread sensitivity of the :class:`MiddlewareMixin.process_request()
  <django.utils.deprecation.MiddlewareMixin>` and ``process_response()`` hooks
  when in an async context (:ticket:`31905`).

* Fixed ``__in`` lookup on key transforms for
  :class:`~django.db.models.JSONField` with MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite
  (:ticket:`31936`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.1 that caused permission errors in
  ``CommonPasswordValidator`` and ``settings.py`` generated by the
  :djadmin:`startproject` command, when user didn't have permissions to all
  intermediate directories in a Django installation path (:ticket:`31912`).

* Fixed detecting an async ``get_response`` callable in various builtin
  middlewares (:ticket:`31928`).

* Fixed a ``QuerySet.order_by()`` crash on PostgreSQL when ordering and
  grouping by :class:`~django.db.models.JSONField` with a custom
  :attr:`~django.db.models.JSONField.decoder` (:ticket:`31956`). As a
  consequence, fetching a ``JSONField`` with raw SQL now returns a string
  instead of preloaded data. You will need to explicitly call ``json.loads()``
  in such cases.

* Fixed a ``QuerySet.delete()`` crash on MySQL, following a performance
  regression in Django 3.1 on MariaDB 10.3.2+, when filtering against an
  aggregate function (:ticket:`31965`).

* Fixed a ``django.contrib.admin.EmptyFieldListFilter`` crash when using on
  reverse relations (:ticket:`31952`).

* Prevented content overflowing in the admin changelist view when the
  navigation sidebar is enabled (:ticket:`31901`).
