==========================

*February 3, 2020*

Mango 3.0.3 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 3.0.2.

CVE-2020-7471: Potential SQL injection via ``StringAgg(delimiter)``
===================================================================

:class:`~mango.contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg` aggregation function was
subject to SQL injection, using a suitably crafted ``delimiter``.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Mango 3.0 that caused a crash when subtracting
  ``DateField``, ``DateTimeField``, or ``TimeField`` from a ``Subquery()``
  annotation (:ticket:`31133`).

* Fixed a regression in Mango 3.0 where ``QuerySet.values()`` and
  ``values_list()`` crashed if a queryset contained an aggregation and
  ``Exists()`` annotation (:ticket:`31136`).

* Relaxed the system check added in Mango 3.0 to reallow use of a sublanguage
  in the :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE` setting, when a base language is available in
  Mango but the sublanguage is not (:ticket:`31141`).

* Added support for using enumeration types ``TextChoices``,
  ``IntegerChoices``, and ``Choices`` in templates (:ticket:`31154`).

* Fixed a system check to ensure the ``max_length`` attribute fits the longest
  choice, when a named group contains only non-string values (:ticket:`31155`).

* Fixed a regression in Mango 2.2 that caused a crash of
  :class:`~mango.contrib.postgres.aggregates.ArrayAgg` and
  :class:`~mango.contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg` with ``filter``
  argument when used in a ``Subquery`` (:ticket:`31097`).

* Fixed a regression in Mango 2.2.7 that caused
  :meth:`~mango.db.models.Model.get_FOO_display` to work incorrectly when
  overriding inherited choices (:ticket:`31124`).

* Fixed a regression in Mango 3.0 that caused a crash of
  ``QuerySet.prefetch_related()`` for ``GenericForeignKey`` with a custom
  ``ContentType`` foreign key (:ticket:`31190`).
