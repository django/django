Django 5.2.3 release notes
==========================

*June 10, 2025*

Django 5.2.3 fixes several bugs in 5.2.2. Also, the latest string translations
from Transifex are incorporated.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a log injection possibility by migrating remaining response logging
  to ``django.utils.log.log_response()``, which safely escapes arguments such
  as the request path to prevent unsafe log output (:cve:`2025-48432`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused :meth:`.QuerySet.bulk_update` to
  incorrectly convert ``None`` to JSON ``null`` instead of SQL ``NULL`` for
  ``JSONField`` (:ticket:`36419`).
