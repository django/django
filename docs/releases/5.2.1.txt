Django 5.2.1 release notes
==========================

*Expected May 7, 2025*

Django 5.2.1 fixes a security issue with severity "moderate" and several bugs
in 5.2.

CVE-2025-32873: Denial-of-service possibility in ``strip_tags()``
=================================================================

:func:`~django.utils.html.strip_tags` would be slow to evaluate certain inputs
containing large sequences of incomplete HTML tags. This function is used to
implement the :tfilter:`striptags` template filter, which was thus also
vulnerable.

:func:`~django.utils.html.strip_tags` now raises a :exc:`.SuspiciousOperation`
exception if it encounters an unusually large number of unclosed opening tags.
