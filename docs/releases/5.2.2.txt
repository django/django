==========================

*June 4, 2025*

Django 5.2.2 fixes a security issue with severity "low" and several bugs in
5.2.1.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a crash when using ``select_related`` against a ``ForeignObject``
  originating from a model with a ``CompositePrimaryKey`` (:ticket:`36373`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.2 where subqueries using ``"pk"`` to reference models
  with a ``CompositePrimaryKey`` failed to raise ``ValueError`` when too many
  or too few columns were selected (:ticket:`36392`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused a crash when no arguments were
  passed into ``QuerySet.union()`` (:ticket:`36388`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 where subclasses of ``RemoteUserMiddleware``
  that had overridden ``process_request()`` were no longer supported
  (:ticket:`36390`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused a crash when using ``OuterRef``
  in the ``filter`` argument of an ``Aggregate`` expression (:ticket:`36404`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused a crash when using ``OuterRef``
  in PostgreSQL aggregate functions ``ArrayAgg``, ``StringAgg``, and
  ``JSONBAgg`` (:ticket:`36405`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 where admin's ``filter_horizontal`` buttons
  lacked ``type="button"``, causing them to intercept form submission when
  pressing the Enter key (:ticket:`36423`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.2 where calling ``QuerySet.in_bulk()`` with an
  ``id_list`` argument on models with a ``CompositePrimaryKey`` failed to
  observe database parameter limits (:ticket:`36416`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.2 where :meth:`HttpRequest.get_preferred_type()
  <django.http.HttpRequest.get_preferred_type>` did not account for media type
  parameters in ``Accept`` headers, reducing specificity in content negotiation
  (:ticket:`36411`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused a crash when using
  ``QuerySet.prefetch_related()`` to prefetch a foreign key with a ``Prefetch``
  queryset for a subclass of the foreign target (:ticket:`36432`).
