Django 1.8 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
============================================

Welcome to Django 1.8!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, as well as some `backwards
incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from Django
1.6 or older versions. We've also dropped some features, which are detailed in
:ref:`our deprecation plan <deprecation-removed-in-1.8>`, and we've `begun the
deprecation process for some features`_.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in Django 1.8`_
.. _`backwards incompatible changes`: `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.8`_
.. _`begun the deprecation process for some features`: `Features deprecated in 1.8`_

Python compatibility
====================

Like Django 1.7, Django 1.8 requires Python 2.7 or above, though we
**highly recommend** the latest minor release.

What's new in Django 1.8
========================

Security enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several features of the django-secure_ third-party library have been
integrated into Django. :class:`django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware`
provides several security enhancements to the request/response cycle. The new
:djadminopt:`--deploy` option of the :djadmin:`check` command allows you to
check your production settings file for ways to increase the security of your
site.

.. _django-secure: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-secure

New PostgreSQL specific functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django now has a module with extensions for PostgreSQL specific features, such
as :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.fields.ArrayField` and
:class:`~django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField`. A full breakdown of the
features is available :doc:`in the documentation</ref/contrib/postgres/index>`.

New data types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Django now has a :class:`~django.db.models.UUIDField` for storing
  universally unique identifiers. There is a corresponding :class:`form field
  <django.forms.UUIDField>`. It is stored as the native ``uuid`` data type on
  PostgreSQL and as a fixed length character field on other backends.

Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:mod:`django.contrib.admin`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* :class:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin` now has a
  :meth:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_module_permission`
  method to allow limiting access to the module on the admin index page.

* :class:`~django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin` now has an attribute
  :attr:`~django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.show_change_link` that
  supports showing a link to an inline object's change form.

* Use the new ``django.contrib.admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter`` in
  :attr:`ModelAdmin.list_filter <django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter>`
  to limit the ``list_filter`` choices to foreign objects which are attached to
  those from the ``ModelAdmin``.

* The :meth:`ModelAdmin.delete_view()
  <django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.delete_view>` displays a summary of objects
  to be deleted on the deletion confirmation page.

* The jQuery library embedded in the admin has been upgraded to version 1.11.1.

* You can now specify :attr:`AdminSite.site_url
  <django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.site_url>` in order to display a link to the
  front-end site.

* You can now specify :attr:`ModelAdmin.show_full_result_count
  <django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.show_full_result_count>` to control whether
  or not the full count of objects should be displayed on a filtered admin page.

:mod:`django.contrib.admindocs`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* reStructuredText is now parsed in model docstrings.

:mod:`django.contrib.auth`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Authorization backends can now raise
  :class:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied` in
  :meth:`~django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_perm`
  and :meth:`~django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_module_perms`
  to short-circuit permission checking.
* :class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm` now
  has a method :meth:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm.send_email`
  that can be overridden to customize the mail to be sent.
* The ``max_length`` of :attr:`Permission.name
  <django.contrib.auth.models.Permission.name>` has been increased from 50 to
  255 characters. Please run the database migration.
* :attr:`~django.contrib.auth.models.CustomUser.USERNAME_FIELD` and
  :attr:`~django.contrib.auth.models.CustomUser.REQUIRED_FIELDS` now supports
  :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey`\s.

:mod:`django.contrib.formtools`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A :doc:`form wizard </ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard>` using the
  :class:`~django.contrib.formtools.wizard.views.CookieWizardView` will now ignore
  an invalid cookie, and the wizard will restart from the first step. An invalid
  cookie can occur in cases of intentional manipulation, but also after a secret
  key change. Previously, this would raise ``WizardViewCookieModified``, a
  ``SuspiciousOperation``, causing an exception for any user with an invalid cookie
  upon every request to the wizard, until the cookie is removed.

:mod:`django.contrib.gis`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Compatibility shims for ``SpatialRefSys`` and ``GeometryColumns`` changed in
  Django 1.2 have been removed.

* The Spatialite backend now supports ``Collect`` and ``Extent`` aggregates
  when the database version is 3.0 or later.

:mod:`django.contrib.messages`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ...

:mod:`django.contrib.redirects`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ...

:mod:`django.contrib.sessions`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Session cookie is now deleted after
  :meth:`~django.contrib.sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.flush()` is called.

:mod:`django.contrib.sitemaps`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The new :attr:`Sitemap.i18n <django.contrib.sitemaps.Sitemap.i18n>` attribute
  allows you to generate a sitemap based on the :setting:`LANGUAGES` setting.

:mod:`django.contrib.sites`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* :func:`~django.contrib.sites.shortcuts.get_current_site` will now lookup
  the current site based on :meth:`request.get_host()
  <django.http.HttpRequest.get_host>` if the :setting:`SITE_ID` setting is not
  defined.

:mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ...

:mod:`django.contrib.syndication`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ...

Cache
^^^^^

* The ``incr()`` method of the
  ``django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache`` backend is now thread-safe.

Database backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The MySQL backend no longer strips microseconds from ``datetime`` values as
  MySQL 5.6.4 and up supports fractional seconds depending on the declaration
  of the datetime field (when ``DATETIME`` includes fractional precision greater
  than 0). New datetime database columns created with Django 1.8 and MySQL 5.6.4
  and up will support microseconds. See the :ref:`MySQL database notes
  <mysql-fractional-seconds>` for more details.

Email
^^^^^

* :ref:`Email backends <topic-email-backends>` now support the context manager
  protocol for opening and closing connections.

* The SMTP email backend now supports ``keyfile`` and ``certfile``
  authentication with the :setting:`EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE` and
  :setting:`EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE` settings.

* The SMTP :class:`~django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend` now supports
  setting the ``timeout`` parameter with the :setting:`EMAIL_TIMEOUT` setting.

File Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ...

File Uploads
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ...

Forms
^^^^^

* Form widgets now render attributes with a value of ``True`` or ``False``
  as HTML5 boolean attributes.

* The new :meth:`~django.forms.Form.has_error()` method allows checking
  if a specific error has happened.

* If :attr:`~django.forms.Form.required_css_class` is defined on a form, then
  the ``<label>`` tags for required fields will have this class present in its
  attributes.

* The rendering of non-field errors in unordered lists (``<ul>``) now includes
  ``nonfield`` in its list of classes to distinguish them from field-specific
  errors.

* :class:`~django.forms.Field` now accepts a
  :attr:`~django.forms.Field.label_suffix` argument, which will override the
  form's :attr:`~django.forms.Form.label_suffix`. This enables customizing the
  suffix on a per-field basis — previously it wasn't possible to override
  a form's :attr:`~django.forms.Form.label_suffix` while using  shortcuts such
  as ``{{ form.as_p }}`` in templates.

* :class:`~django.forms.extras.widgets.SelectDateWidget` now accepts an
  :attr:`~django.forms.extras.widgets.SelectDateWidget.empty_label` argument, which will
  override the top list choice label when :class:`~django.forms.DateField` is not required.

* After an :class:`~django.forms.ImageField` has been cleaned and validated, the
  ``UploadedFile`` object will have an additional ``image`` attribute containing
  the Pillow ``Image`` instance used to check if the file was a valid image. It
  will also update ``UploadedFile.content_type`` with the image's content type
  as determined by Pillow.

* You can now pass a callable that returns an iterable of choices when
  instantiating a :class:`~django.forms.ChoiceField`.

Generic Views
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Generic views that use :class:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin`
  may now specify the ordering applied to the
  :attr:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.queryset` by setting
  :attr:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.ordering` or overriding
  :meth:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.get_ordering()`.

* The new :attr:`SingleObjectMixin.query_pk_and_slug
  <django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin.query_pk_and_slug>`
  attribute allows changing the behavior of
  :meth:`~django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin.get_object()`
  so that it'll perform its lookup using both the primary key and the slug.

* The :meth:`~django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin.get_form()` method doesn't
  require a ``form_class`` to be provided anymore. If not provided ``form_class``
  defaults to :meth:`~django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin.get_form_class()`.

Internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* :setting:`FORMAT_MODULE_PATH` can now be a list of strings representing
  module paths. This allows importing several format modules from different
  reusable apps. It also allows overriding those custom formats in your main
  Django project.

Management Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* :djadmin:`dumpdata` now has the option :djadminopt:`--output` which allows
  specifying the file to which the serialized data is written.

* :djadmin:`makemessages` and :djadmin:`compilemessages` now have the option
  :djadminopt:`--exclude` which allows exclusion of specific locales from
  processing.

* The :djadminopt:`--ignorenonexistent` option of the :djadmin:`loaddata`
  management command now ignores data for models that no longer exist.

* :djadmin:`runserver` now uses daemon threads for faster reloading.

* :djadmin:`inspectdb` now outputs ``Meta.unique_together``.

* When calling management commands from code through :ref:`call_command
  <call-command>` and passing options, the option name can match the command
  line option name (without the initial dashes) or the final option destination
  variable name, but in either case, the resulting option received by the
  command is now always the ``dest`` name specified in the command option
  definition (as long as the command uses the new :py:mod:`argparse` module).

* The :djadmin:`dbshell` command now supports MySQL's optional SSL certificate
  authority setting (``--ssl-ca``).

* The :djadminopt:`--name` option for :djadmin:`makemigrations` allows you to
  to give the migration(s) a custom name instead of a generated one.

* The :djadmin:`loaddata` command now prevents repeated fixture loading. If
  :setting:`FIXTURE_DIRS` contains duplicates or a default fixture directory
  path (``app_name/fixtures``), an exception is raised.

Middleware
^^^^^^^^^^

* The :attr:`CommonMiddleware.response_redirect_class
  <django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware.response_redirect_class>`
  attribute allows you to customize the redirects issued by the middleware.

Migrations
^^^^^^^^^^

* The :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL` operation can now handle
  parameters passed to the SQL statements.

* It is now possible to have migrations (most probably :ref:`data migrations
  <data-migrations>`) for applications without models.

Models
^^^^^^

* Django now logs at most 9000 queries in ``connections.queries``, in order
  to prevent excessive memory usage in long-running processes in debug mode.

* There is now a model ``Meta`` option to define a
  :attr:`default related name <django.db.models.Options.default_related_name>`
  for all relational fields of a model.

* Pickling models and querysets across different versions of Django isn't
  officially supported (it may work, but there's no guarantee). An extra
  variable that specifies the current Django version is now added to the
  pickled state of models and querysets, and Django raises a ``RuntimeWarning``
  when these objects are unpickled in a different version than the one in
  which they were pickled.

* Added :meth:`Model.from_db() <django.db.models.Model.from_db()>` which
  Django uses whenever objects are loaded using the ORM. The method allows
  customizing model loading behavior.

* ``extra(select={...})`` now allows you to escape a literal ``%s`` sequence
  using ``%%s``.

* :doc:`Custom Lookups</howto/custom-lookups>` can now be registered using
  a decorator pattern.

* The new :attr:`Transform.bilateral <django.db.models.Transform.bilateral>`
  attribute allows creating bilateral transformations. These transformations
  are applied to both ``lhs`` and ``rhs`` when used in a lookup expression,
  providing opportunities for more sophisticated lookups.

Signals
^^^^^^^

* Exceptions from the ``(receiver, exception)`` tuples returned by
  :meth:`Signal.send_robust() <django.dispatch.Signal.send_robust>` now have
  their traceback attached as a ``__traceback__`` attribute.

* The ``environ`` argument, which contains the WSGI environment structure from
  the request, was added to the :data:`~django.core.signals.request_started`
  signal.

Templates
^^^^^^^^^

* :tfilter:`urlize` now supports domain-only links that include characters after
  the top-level domain (e.g. ``djangoproject.com/`` and
  ``djangoproject.com/download/``).

* :tfilter:`urlize` doesn't treat exclamation marks at the end of a domain or
  its query string as part of the URL (the URL in e.g. ``'djangoproject.com!``
  is ``djangoproject.com``)

Requests and Responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``WSGIRequest`` now respects paths starting with ``//``.

* The :meth:`HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri()
  <django.http.HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri>` method now handles paths
  starting with ``//`` correctly.

* If :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True`` and a request raises a
  :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation`, the response will be
  rendered with a detailed error page.

* The ``query_string`` argument of :class:`~django.http.QueryDict` is now
  optional, defaulting to ``None``, so a blank ``QueryDict`` can now be
  instantiated with ``QueryDict()`` instead of ``QueryDict(None)`` or
  ``QueryDict('')``.

* The ``GET`` and ``POST`` attributes of an :class:`~django.http.HttpRequest`
  object are now :class:`~django.http.QueryDict`\s rather than dictionaries,
  and the ``FILES`` attribute is now a ``MultiValueDict``.
  This brings this class into line with the documentation and with
  ``WSGIRequest``.

* The :attr:`HttpResponse.charset <django.http.HttpResponse.charset>` attribute
  was added.

* ``WSGIRequestHandler`` now follows RFC in converting URI to IRI, using
  ``uri_to_iri()``.

* The :meth:`HttpRequest.get_full_path()
  <django.http.HttpRequest.get_full_path>` method now escapes unsafe characters
  from the path portion of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) properly.

* :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse` now implements a few additional methods
  like :meth:`~django.http.HttpResponse.getvalue` so that instances can be used
  as stream objects.

Tests
^^^^^

* The :class:`RequestFactory.trace() <django.test.RequestFactory>`
  and :class:`Client.trace() <django.test.Client.trace>` methods were
  implemented, allowing you to create ``TRACE`` requests in your tests.

* The ``count`` argument was added to
  :meth:`~django.test.SimpleTestCase.assertTemplateUsed`. This allows you to
  assert that a template was rendered a specific number of times.

* The new :meth:`~django.test.SimpleTestCase.assertJSONNotEqual` assertion
  allows you to test that two JSON fragments are not equal.

* Added the ability to preserve the test database by adding the
  :djadminopt:`--keepdb` flag.

* Added the :attr:`~django.test.Response.resolver_match` attribute to test
  client responses.

* Added several settings that allow customization of test tablespace parameters
  for Oracle: :setting:`DATAFILE`, :setting:`DATAFILE_TMP`,
  :setting:`DATAFILE_MAXSIZE` and :setting:`DATAFILE_TMP_MAXSIZE`.

Validators
^^^^^^^^^^

Backwards incompatible changes in 1.8
=====================================

.. warning::

    In addition to the changes outlined in this section, be sure to review the
    :ref:`deprecation plan <deprecation-removed-in-1.8>` for any features that
    have been removed. If you haven't updated your code within the
    deprecation timeline for a given feature, its removal may appear as a
    backwards incompatible change.

Related object operations are run in a transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some operations on related objects such as
:meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.add()` or
:ref:`direct assignment<direct-assignment>` ran multiple data modifying
queries without wrapping them in transactions. To reduce the risk of data
corruption, all data modifying methods that affect multiple related objects
(i.e. ``add()``, ``remove()``, ``clear()``, and :ref:`direct assignment
<direct-assignment>`) now perform their data modifying queries from within a
transaction, provided your database supports transactions.

This has one backwards incompatible side effect, signal handlers triggered from
these methods are now executed within the method's transaction and any
exception in a signal handler will prevent the whole operation.

Assigning unsaved objects to relations raises an error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assigning unsaved objects to a :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey`,
:class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey`, and
:class:`~django.db.models.OneToOneField` now raises a :exc:`ValueError`.

Previously, the assignment of an unsaved object would be silently ignored.
For example::

    >>> book = Book.objects.create(name="Django")
    >>> book.author = Author(name="John")
    >>> book.author.save()
    >>> book.save()

    >>> Book.objects.get(name="Django")
    >>> book.author
    >>>

Now, an error will be raised to prevent data loss::

    >>> book.author = Author(name="john")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Cannot assign "<Author: John>": "Author" instance isn't saved in the database.

Management commands that only accept positional arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have written a custom management command that only accepts positional
arguments and you didn't specify the
:attr:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand.args` command variable, you might
get an error like ``Error: unrecognized arguments: ...``, as variable parsing
is now based on :py:mod:`argparse` which doesn't implicitly accept positional
arguments. You can make your command backwards compatible by simply setting the
:attr:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand.args` class variable. However, if
you don't have to keep compatibility with older Django versions, it's better to
implement the new :meth:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand.add_arguments`
method as described in :doc:`/howto/custom-management-commands`.

Custom test management command arguments through test runner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method to add custom arguments to the `test` management command through the
test runner has changed. Previously, you could provide an `option_list` class
variable on the test runner to add more arguments (à la :py:mod:`optparse`).
Now to implement the same behavior, you have to create an
``add_arguments(cls, parser)`` class method on the test runner and call
``parser.add_argument`` to add any custom arguments, as parser is now an
:py:class:`argparse.ArgumentParser` instance.

Model check ensures auto-generated column names are within limits specified by database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A field name that's longer than the column name length supported by a database
can create problems. For example, with MySQL you'll get an exception trying to
create the column, and with PostgreSQL the column name is truncated by the
database (you may see a warning in the PostgreSQL logs).

A model check has been introduced to better alert users to this scenario before
the actual creation of database tables.

If you have an existing model where this check seems to be a false positive,
for example on PostgreSQL where the name was already being truncated, simply
use :attr:`~django.db.models.Field.db_column` to specify the name that's being
used.

The check also applies to the columns generated in an implicit
``ManyToManyField.through`` model. If you run into an issue there, use
:attr:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through` to create an explicit model
and then specify :attr:`~django.db.models.Field.db_column` on its column(s)
as needed.

Query relation lookups now check object types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Querying for model lookups now checks if the object passed is of correct type
and raises a :exc:`ValueError` if not. Previously, Django didn't care if the
object was of correct type; it just used the object's related field attribute
(e.g. ``id``) for the lookup. Now, an error is raised to prevent incorrect
lookups::

    >>> book = Book.objects.create(name="Django")
    >>> book = Book.objects.filter(author=book)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Cannot query "<Book: Django>": Must be "Author" instance.

Default ``EmailField.max_length`` increased to 254
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The old default 75 character ``max_length`` was not capable of storing all
possible RFC3696/5321-compliant email addresses. In order to store all
possible valid email addresses, the ``max_length`` has been increased to 254
characters. You will need to generate and apply database migrations for your
affected models (or add ``max_length=75`` if you wish to keep the length on
your current fields). A migration for
:attr:`django.contrib.auth.models.User.email` is included.

Support for PostgreSQL versions older than 9.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The end of upstream support periods was reached in July 2014 for PostgreSQL 8.4.
As a consequence, Django 1.8 sets 9.0 as the minimum PostgreSQL version it
officially supports.

This also includes dropping support for PostGIS 1.3 and 1.4 as these versions
are not supported on versions of PostgreSQL later than 8.4.

Django also now requires the use of Psycopg2 version 2.0.9 or higher.

Support for MySQL versions older than 5.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The end of upstream support periods was reached in January 2012 for MySQL 5.0
and December 2013 for MySQL 5.1. As a consequence, Django 1.8 sets 5.5 as the
minimum MySQL version it officially supports.

Support for Oracle versions older than 11.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The end of upstream support periods was reached in July 2010 for Oracle 9.2,
January 2012 for Oracle 10.1, and July 2013 for Oracle 10.2. As a consequence,
Django 1.8 sets 11.1 as the minimum Oracle version it officially supports.

Specific privileges used instead of roles for tests on Oracle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Earlier versions of Django granted the CONNECT and RESOURCE roles to the test
user on Oracle. These roles have been deprecated, so Django 1.8 uses the
specific underlying privileges instead. This changes the privileges required
of the main user for running tests (unless the project is configured to avoid
creating a test user). The exact privileges required now are detailed in
:ref:`Oracle notes <oracle-notes>`.

``AbstractUser.last_login`` allows null values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :attr:`AbstractUser.last_login <django.contrib.auth.models.User.last_login>`
field now allows null values. Previously, it defaulted to the time when the user
was created which was misleading if the user never logged in. Please run the
database migration. If your custom user inherits from ``AbstractUser`` and you
wish to set ``last_login`` to ``NULL`` for users who haven't logged in, you can
run this query::

    from django.db import models
    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser

    UserModel = get_user_model()
    if issubclass(UserModel, AbstractBaseUser):
        UserModel._default_manager.filter(
            last_login=models.F('date_joined')
        ).update(last_login=None)

:mod:`django.contrib.gis`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for GEOS 3.1 and GDAL 1.6 has been dropped.

* Support for SpatiaLite < 2.4 has been dropped.

* GIS-specific lookups have been refactored to use the
  :class:`django.db.models.Lookup` API.

* The default ``str`` representation of
  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.geos.GEOSGeometry` objects has been changed from
  WKT to EWKT format (including the SRID). As this representation is used in
  the serialization framework, that means that ``dumpdata`` output will now
  contain the SRID value of geometry objects.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``connections.queries`` is now a read-only attribute.

* Database connections are considered equal only if they're the same object.
  They aren't hashable any more.

* :class:`~django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware` used to disable compression
  for some content types when the request is from Internet Explorer, in order
  to work around a bug in IE6 and earlier. This behavior could affect
  performance on IE7 and later. It was removed.

* ``URLField.to_python`` no longer adds a trailing slash to pathless URLs.

* The :tfilter:`length` template filter now returns ``0`` for an undefined
  variable, rather than an empty string.

* ``ForeignKey.default_error_message['invalid']`` has been changed from
  ``'%(model)s instance with pk %(pk)r does not exist.'`` to
  ``'%(model)s instance with %(field)s %(value)r does not exist.'`` If you are
  using this message in your own code, please update the list of interpolated
  parameters. Internally, Django will continue to provide the
  ``pk`` parameter in ``params`` for backwards compatibility.

* ``UserCreationForm.errors_messages['duplicate_username']`` is no longer used.
  If you wish to customize that error message, :ref:`override it on the form
  <modelforms-overriding-default-fields>` using the ``'unique'`` key in
  ``Meta.errors_messages['username']`` or, if you have a custom form field for
  ``'username'``, using the the ``'unique'`` key in its
  :attr:`~django.forms.Field.error_messages` argument.

* ``AdminSite`` no longer takes an ``app_name`` argument and its ``app_name``
  attribute has been removed. The application name is always ``admin`` (as
  opposed to the instance name which you can still customize using
  ``AdminSite(name="...")``.

* Internal changes were made to the :class:`~django.forms.ClearableFileInput`
  widget to allow more customization. The undocumented ``url_markup_template``
  attribute was removed in favor of ``template_with_initial``.

* For consistency with other major vendors, the ``en_GB`` locale now has Monday
  as the first day of the week.

* Seconds have been removed from any locales that had them in ``TIME_FORMAT``,
  ``DATETIME_FORMAT``, or ``SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT``.

* The default max size of the Oracle test tablespace has increased from 200M
  to 500M.

* :func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse` and
  :func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse_lazy` now return Unicode strings
  instead of byte strings.

* The ``CacheClass`` shim has been removed from all cache backends.
  These aliases were provided for backwards compatibility with Django 1.3.
  If you are still using them, please update your project to use the real
  class name found in the :setting:`BACKEND <CACHES-BACKEND>` key of the
  :setting:`CACHES` setting.

* By default, :ref:`call_command <call-command>` now always skips the check
  framework (unless you pass it ``skip_checks=False``).

* When iterating over lines, :class:`~django.core.files.File` now uses
  `universal newlines`_. The following are recognized as ending a line: the
  Unix end-of-line convention ``'\n'``, the Windows convention ``'\r\n'``, and
  the old Macintosh convention ``'\r'``.

  .. _universal newlines: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0278

.. _deprecated-features-1.8:

Features deprecated in 1.8
==========================

Loading ``cycle`` and ``firstof`` template tags from ``future`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django 1.6 introduced ``{% load cycle from future %}`` and
``{% load firstof from future %}`` syntax for forward compatibility of the
:ttag:`cycle` and :ttag:`firstof` template tags. This syntax is now deprecated
and will be removed in Django 2.0. You can simply remove the
``{% load ... from future %}`` tags.

``django.conf.urls.patterns()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the olden days of Django, it was encouraged to reference views as strings
in ``urlpatterns``::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url('^$', 'myapp.views.myview'),
    )

and Django would magically import ``myapp.views.myview`` internally and turn
the string into a real function reference. In order to reduce repetition when
referencing many views from the same module, the ``patterns()`` function takes
a required initial ``prefix`` argument which is prepended to all
views-as-strings in that set of ``urlpatterns``::

    urlpatterns = patterns('myapp.views',
        url('^$', 'myview'),
        url('^other/$', 'otherview'),
    )

In the modern era, we have updated the tutorial to instead recommend importing
your views module and referencing your view functions (or classes) directly.
This has a number of advantages, all deriving from the fact that we are using
normal Python in place of "Django String Magic": the errors when you mistype a
view name are less obscure, IDEs can help with autocompletion of view names,
etc.

So these days, the above use of the ``prefix`` arg is much more likely to be
written (and is better written) as::

    from myapp import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url('^$', views.myview),
        url('^other/$', views.otherview),
    )

Thus ``patterns()`` serves little purpose and is a burden when teaching new users
(answering the newbie's question "why do I need this empty string as the first
argument to ``patterns()``?"). For these reasons, we are deprecating it.
Updating your code is as simple as ensuring that ``urlpatterns`` is a list of
:func:`django.conf.urls.url` instances. For example::

    from django.conf.urls import url
    from myapp import views

    urlpatterns = [
        url('^$', views.myview),
        url('^other/$', views.otherview),
    ]

Passing a string as ``view`` to :func:`~django.conf.urls.url`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to the previous item, referencing views as strings in the ``url()``
function is deprecated. Pass the callable view as described in the previous
section instead.

``django.test.SimpleTestCase.urls``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The attribute :attr:`SimpleTestCase.urls <django.test.SimpleTestCase.urls>`
for specifying URLconf configuration in tests has been deprecated and will be
removed in Django 2.0. Use :func:`@override_settings(ROOT_URLCONF=...)
<django.test.override_settings>` instead.

``prefix`` argument to :func:`~django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to the previous item, the ``prefix`` argument to
:func:`django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns` has been deprecated. Simply pass a
list of :func:`django.conf.urls.url` instances instead.

Using an incorrect count of unpacked values in the :ttag:`for` template tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using an incorrect count of unpacked values in :ttag:`for` tag will raise an
exception rather than fail silently in Django 2.0.

Passing a dotted path to :func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse()` and :ttag:`url`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reversing URLs by Python path is an expensive operation as it causes the
path being reversed to be imported. This behavior has also resulted in a
`security issue`_. Use :ref:`named URL patterns <naming-url-patterns>`
for reversing instead.

If you are using :mod:`django.contrib.sitemaps`, add the ``name`` argument to
the ``url`` that references :func:`django.contrib.sitemaps.views.sitemap`::

    from django.contrib.sitemaps.views import sitemap

    url(r'^sitemap\.xml$', sitemap, {'sitemaps': sitemaps},
        name='django.contrib.sitemaps.views.sitemap')

to ensure compatibility when reversing by Python path is removed in Django 2.0.

Similarly for GIS sitemaps, add ``name='django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.kml'``
or ``name='django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.kmz'``.

Extending management command arguments through ``Command.option_list``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Management commands now use :py:mod:`argparse` instead of :py:mod:`optparse` to
parse command-line arguments passed to commands. This also means that the way
to add custom arguments to commands has changed: instead of extending the
``option_list`` class list, you should now override the
:meth:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand.add_arguments` method and add
arguments through ``argparse.add_argument()``. See
:ref:`this example <custom-commands-options>` for more details.

``django.core.management.NoArgsCommand``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The class :class:`~django.core.management.NoArgsCommand` is now deprecated and
will be removed in Django 2.0. Use :class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand`
instead, which takes no arguments by default.

``cache_choices`` option of ``ModelChoiceField`` and ``ModelMultipleChoiceField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`~django.forms.ModelChoiceField` and
:class:`~django.forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField` took an undocumented, untested
option ``cache_choices``. This cached querysets between multiple renderings of
the same ``Form`` object. This option is subject to an accelerated deprecation
and will be removed in Django 1.9.

``django.template.resolve_variable()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function has been informally marked as "Deprecated" for some time. Replace
``resolve_variable(path, context)`` with
``django.template.Variable(path).resolve(context)``.

``django.contrib.webdesign``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It provided the :ttag:`lorem` template tag which is now included in the
built-in tags. Simply remove ``'django.contrib.webdesign'`` from
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` and ``{% load webdesign %}`` from your templates.

``error_message`` argument to ``django.forms.RegexField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It provided backwards compatibility for pre-1.0 code, but its functionality is
redundant. Use ``Field.error_messages['invalid']`` instead.

Old :tfilter:`unordered_list` syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An older (pre-1.0), more restrictive and verbose input format for the
:tfilter:`unordered_list` template filter has been deprecated::

    ``['States', [['Kansas', [['Lawrence', []], ['Topeka', []]]], ['Illinois', []]]]``

Using the new syntax, this becomes::

    ``['States', ['Kansas', ['Lawrence', 'Topeka'], 'Illinois']]``

``django.forms.Field._has_changed()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rename this method to :meth:`~django.forms.Field.has_changed` by removing the
leading underscore. The old name will still work until Django 2.0.

``django.utils.html.remove_tags()`` and ``removetags`` template filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.html.remove_tags()`` as well as the template filter
``removetags`` have been deprecated as they cannot guarantee safe output. Their
existence is likely to lead to their use in security-sensitive contexts where
they are not actually safe.

The unused and undocumented ``django.utils.html.strip_entities()`` function has
also been deprecated.

``is_admin_site`` argument to ``django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's a legacy option that should no longer be necessary.

``SubfieldBase``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.db.models.fields.subclassing.SubfieldBase`` has been deprecated and
will be removed in Django 2.0. Historically, it was used to handle fields where
type conversion was needed when loading from the database, but it was not used
in ``.values()`` calls or in aggregates. It has been replaced with
:meth:`~django.db.models.Field.from_db_value`. Note that the new approach does
not call the :meth:`~django.db.models.Field.to_python` method on assignment
as was the case with ``SubfieldBase``.

``django.utils.checksums``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``django.utils.checksums`` module has been deprecated and will be removed
in Django 2.0. The functionality it provided (validating checksum using the
Luhn algorithm) was undocumented and not used in Django. The module has been
moved to the `django-localflavor`_ package (version 1.1+).

.. _django-localflavor: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-localflavor

``django.contrib.admin.helpers.InlineAdminForm.original_content_type_id``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``original_content_type_id`` attribute on ``InlineAdminForm`` has been
deprecated and will be removed in Django 2.0. Historically, it was used
to construct the "view on site" URL. This URL is now accessible using the
``absolute_url`` attribute of the form.

``django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin.get_form()``’s ``form_class`` argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``FormMixin`` subclasses that override the ``get_form()`` method should make
sure to provide a default value for the ``form_class`` argument since it's
now optional.

Overriding ``setUpClass`` / ``tearDownClass`` in test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The decorators :func:`~django.test.override_settings` and
:func:`~django.test.modify_settings` now act at the class level when used as
class decorators. As a consequence, when overriding ``setUpClass()`` or
``tearDownClass()``, the ``super`` implementation should always be called.
