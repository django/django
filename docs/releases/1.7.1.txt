Django 1.7.1 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.7.1 fixes several bugs in 1.7.

Bugfixes
========

* Added a more helpful error message if you try to migrate an app without first
  creating the ``contenttypes`` table (:ticket:`22411`).

* Modified migrations dependency algorithm to avoid possible infinite recursion.

* Fixed a ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when the ``flush`` error message contained
  Unicode characters (:ticket:`22882`).

* Reinstated missing ``CHECK`` SQL clauses which were omitted on some backends
  when not using migrations (:ticket:`23416`).

* Fixed serialization of ``type`` objects in migrations (:ticket:`22951`).

* Allowed inline and hidden references to admin fields (:ticket:`23431`).

* The ``@deconstructible`` decorator now fails with a ``ValueError`` if the
  decorated object cannot automatically be imported (:ticket:`23418`).

* Fixed a typo in an ``inlineformset_factory()`` error message that caused a
  crash (:ticket:`23451`).

* Restored the ability to use :setting:`ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES` with the
  ``'auth.User'`` model (:ticket:`11775`). As a side effect, the setting now
  adds a ``get_absolute_url()`` method to any model that appears in
  ``ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES`` but doesn't define ``get_absolute_url()``.

* Avoided masking some `ImportError` exceptions during application loading
  (:ticket:`22920`).

* Empty ``index_together`` or ``unique_together`` model options no longer
  results in infinite migrations (:ticket:`23452`).

* Fixed crash in ``contrib.sitemaps`` if ``lastmod`` returned a ``date`` rather
  than a ``datetime`` (:ticket:`23403`).

* Allowed migrations to work with ``app_label``\s that have the same last
  part (e.g. ``django.contrib.auth`` and ``vendor.auth``) (:ticket:`23483`).

* Fixed bug in migrations that could cause unexpected data loss when executing
  a backwards or no-op migration (:ticket:`23474`).
