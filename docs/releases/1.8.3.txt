Django 1.8.3 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.8.3 fixes several bugs in 1.8.2.

Also, ``django.utils.deprecation.RemovedInDjango20Warning`` was renamed to
``RemovedInDjango110Warning`` as the version roadmap was revised to 1.9, 1.10,
1.11 (LTS), 2.0 (drops Python 2 support). For backwards compatibility,
``RemovedInDjango20Warning`` remains as an importable alias.

  ``Count()`` (:ticket:`24835`).

* Corrected ``HStoreField.has_changed()`` (:ticket:`24844`).

  a regression (:ticket:`24836`).

* Fixed a regression which caused template context processors to overwrite
  variables set on a ``RequestContext`` after it's created (:ticket:`24847`).
