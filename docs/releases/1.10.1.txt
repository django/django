Django 1.10.1 release notes
===========================

*Under development*

Django 1.10.1 fixes several bugs in 1.10.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a crash in MySQL connections where ``SELECT @@SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL``
  doesn't return a result (:ticket:`26991`).

* Allowed ``User.is_authenticated`` and ``User.is_anonymous`` properties to be
  compared using ``==`` and ``!=`` (:ticket:`26988`).

* Removed the broken ``BaseCommand.usage()`` method which was for
  ``optparse`` support (:ticket:`27000`).

* Fixed a checks framework crash with an empty ``Meta.default_permissions``
  (:ticket:`26997`).

* Fixed a regression in the number of queries when using ``RadioSelect`` with a
  ``ModelChoiceField`` form field (:ticket:`27001`).

* Fixed a crash if ``request.META['CONTENT_LENGTH']`` is an empty string
  (:ticket:`27005`).

* Fixed the ``isnull`` lookup on a ``ForeignKey`` with its ``to_field``
  pointing to a ``CharField`` (:ticket:`26983`).

* Prevented the ``migrate`` command from raising
  ``InconsistentMigrationHistory`` in the presence of unapplied squashed
  migrations (:ticket:`27004`).

* Fixed a regression in ``Client.force_login()`` which required specifying a
  ``backend`` rather than automatically using the first one if multiple
  backends are configured (:ticket:`27027`).

* Made ``QuerySet.bulk_create()`` properly initialize model instances on
  backends, such as PostgreSQL, that support returning the IDs of the created
  records so that many-to-many relationships can be used on the new objects
  (:ticket:`27026`).

* Fixed crash of ``django.views.static.serve()`` with ``show_indexes`` enabled
  (:ticket:`26973`).

* Fixed ``ClearableFileInput`` to avoid the ``required`` HTML attribute when
  initial data exists (:ticket:`27037`).

* Fixed annotations with database functions when combined with lookups on
  PostGIS (:ticket:`27014`).
