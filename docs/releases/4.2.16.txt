Django 4.2.16 release notes
===========================

*September 3, 2024*

Django 4.2.16 fixes one security issue with severity "moderate" and one
security issue with severity "low" in 4.2.15.

CVE-2024-45230: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in ``django.utils.html.urlize()``
===========================================================================================

:tfilter:`urlize` and :tfilter:`urlizetrunc` were subject to a potential
denial-of-service attack via very large inputs with a specific sequence of
characters.

CVE-2024-45231: Potential user email enumeration via response status on password reset
======================================================================================

Due to unhandled email sending failures, the
:class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm` class allowed remote
attackers to enumerate user emails by issuing password reset requests and
observing the outcomes.

To mitigate this risk, exceptions occurring during password reset email sending
are now handled and logged using the :ref:`django-contrib-auth-logger` logger.
