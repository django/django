Django 1.9.2 release notes
==========================

*February 1, 2016*

Django 1.9.2 fixes a security regression in 1.9 and several bugs in 1.9.1. It
also makes a small backwards incompatible change that hopefully doesn't affect
any users.

Security issue: User with "change" but not "add" permission can create objects for ``ModelAdmin``’s with ``save_as=True``
=========================================================================================================================

If a ``ModelAdmin`` uses ``save_as=True`` (not the default), the admin
provides an option when editing objects to "Save as new". A regression in
Django 1.9 prevented that form submission from raising a "Permission Denied"
error for users without the "add" permission.

Backwards incompatible change: ``.py-tpl`` files rewritten in project/app templates
===================================================================================

The addition of some Django template language syntax to the default app
template in Django 1.9 means those files now have some invalid Python syntax.
This causes difficulties for packaging systems that unconditionally
byte-compile ``*.py`` files.

To remedy this, a ``.py-tpl`` suffix is now used for the project and app
template files included in Django. The ``.py-tpl`` suffix is replaced with
``.py`` by the ``startproject`` and ``startapp`` commands. For example, a
template with the filename ``manage.py-tpl`` will be created as ``manage.py``.

Please file a ticket if you have a custom project template containing
``.py-tpl`` files and find this behavior problematic.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in ``ConditionalGetMiddleware`` causing ``If-None-Match``
  checks to always return HTTP 200 (:ticket:`26024`).

* Fixed a regression that caused the "user-tools" items to display on the
  admin's logout page (:ticket:`26035`).

* Fixed a crash in the translations system when the current language has no
  translations (:ticket:`26046`).

* Fixed a regression that caused the incorrect day to be selected when opening
  the admin calendar widget for timezones from GMT+0100 to GMT+1200
  (:ticket:`24980`).

* Fixed a regression in the admin's edit related model popup that caused an
  escaped value to be displayed in the select dropdown of the parent window
  (:ticket:`25997`).

* Fixed a regression in 1.8.8 causing incorrect index handling in migrations on
  PostgreSQL when adding ``db_index=True`` or ``unique=True`` to a
  ``CharField`` or ``TextField`` that already had the other specified, or when
  removing one of them from a field that had both, or when adding
  ``unique=True`` to a field already listed in ``unique_together``
  (:ticket:`26034`).

* Fixed a regression where defining a relation on an abstract model's field
  using a string model name without an app_label no longer resolved that
  reference to the abstract model's app if using that model in another
  application (:ticket:`25858`).

* Fixed a crash when destroying an existing test database on MySQL or
  PostgreSQL (:ticket:`26096`).

* Fixed CSRF cookie check on POST requests when ``USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT=True``
  (:ticket:`26094`).

* Fixed a ``QuerySet.order_by()`` crash when ordering by a relational field of
  a ``ManyToManyField`` ``through`` model (:ticket:`26092`).

* Fixed a regression that caused an exception when making database queries on
  SQLite with more than 2000 parameters when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True`` on
  distributions that increase the ``SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER`` compile-time
  limit to over 2000, such as Debian (:ticket:`26063`).

* Fixed a crash when using a reverse ``OneToOneField`` in
  ``ModelAdmin.readonly_fields`` (:ticket:`26060`).

* Fixed a crash when calling the ``migrate`` command in a test case with the
  ``available_apps`` attribute pointing to an application with migrations
  disabled using the ``MIGRATION_MODULES`` setting (:ticket:`26135`).

* Restored the ability for testing and debugging tools to determine the
  template from which a node came from, even during template inheritance or
  inclusion. Prior to Django 1.9, debugging tools could access the template
  origin from the node via ``Node.token.source[0]``. This was an undocumented,
  private API. The origin is now available directly on each node using the
  ``Node.origin`` attribute (:ticket:`25848`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 1.8.5 that broke copying a ``SimpleLazyObject``
  with ``copy.copy()`` (:ticket:`26122`).

* Always included ``geometry_field`` in the GeoJSON serializer output regardless
  of the ``fields`` parameter (:ticket:`26138`).

* Fixed the ``contrib.gis`` map widgets when using
  ``USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR=True`` (:ticket:`20415`).

* Made invalid forms display the initial of values of their disabled fields
  (:ticket:`26129`).
