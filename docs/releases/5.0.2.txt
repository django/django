CVE-2024-24680: Potential denial-of-service in ``intcomma`` template filter
===========================================================================

The ``intcomma`` template filter was subject to a potential denial-of-service
attack when used with very long strings.

Bugfixes
========

* Reallowed, following a regression in Django 5.0.1, filtering against local
  foreign keys not included in :attr:`.ModelAdmin.list_filter`
  (:ticket:`35087`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 where links in the admin had an incorrect
  color (:ticket:`35121`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of ``Model.full_clean()`` on
  models with a ``GeneratedField`` (:ticket:`35127`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of
  ``FilteredRelation()`` with querysets as right-hand sides (:ticket:`35135`).
  ``FilteredRelation()`` now raises a ``ValueError`` on querysets as right-hand
  sides.

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of the ``dumpdata``
  management command when a base queryset used ``prefetch_related()``
  (:ticket:`35159`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused the ``request_finished`` signal
  to sometimes not be fired when running Django through an ASGI server,
  resulting in potential resource leaks (:ticket:`35059`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a migration crash on MySQL when adding
  a ``BinaryField``, ``TextField``, ``JSONField``, or ``GeometryField`` with a
  ``db_default`` (:ticket:`35162`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a migration crash on models with a
  literal ``db_default`` of a complex type such as ``dict`` instance of a
  ``JSONField``. Running ``makemigrations`` might generate no-op ``AlterField``
  operations for fields using ``db_default`` (:ticket:`35149`).
