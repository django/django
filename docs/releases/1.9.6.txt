==========================
Django 1.9.6 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.9.6 fixes several bugs in 1.9.5.

Bugfixes
========

* Added support for relative path redirects to
  ``SimpleTestCase.assertRedirects()`` because Django 1.9 no longer converts
  redirects to absolute URIs (:ticket:`26428`).

* Prevented ``makemigrations`` from mistakenly thinking a model field that
  uses a ``functools.partial`` has changed when it has not. (:ticket:`26475`).
