Django 6.0.1 release notes
==========================

*Expected January 6, 2026*

Django 6.0.1 fixes several bugs in 6.0.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 6.0 where :ttag:`querystring` mishandled
  multi-value :class:`~django.http.QueryDict` keys, both by only preserving the
  last value and by incorrectly handling ``None`` values (:ticket:`36783`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 6.0 in the renaming of permissions to match renamed
  models where conflicts were skipped silently. Conflicts encountered (e.g.
  when migrating backward in an environment with pre-Django 6.0 permissions
  that did not get renamed) are now resolved by preserving the permissions
  attached to the model being renamed (:ticket:`36793`).
