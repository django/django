Django 6.0.1 release notes
==========================

*January 6, 2026*

Django 6.0.1 fixes one data loss bug introduced in Django 5.2 as well as
several other bugs in Django 6.0.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.2 where data exceeding ``max_length`` was silently
  truncated by :meth:`.QuerySet.bulk_create` on PostgreSQL (:ticket:`33647`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 6.0 where :ttag:`querystring` mishandled
  multi-value :class:`~django.http.QueryDict` keys, both by only preserving the
  last value and by incorrectly handling ``None`` values (:ticket:`36783`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 6.0 that prevented changing the name of a
  :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` from taking effect when applying
  migrations (:ticket:`36800`).

* Fixed a bug where management command colorized help (introduced in
  Python 3.14) ignored the :option:`--no-color` option and the
  :envvar:`DJANGO_COLORS` setting (:ticket:`36376`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 6.0 that caused
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.bulk_create` to crash
  when introspecting the connection on SQLite (:ticket:`36818`).

* Fixed a visual regression in Django 6.0 for admin form fields grouped under a
  ``<fieldset>`` in Safari (:ticket:`36807`).

* Fixed a crash in Django 6.0 caused by infinite recursion when calling
  ``repr()`` on an unevaluated ``django.utils.csp.LazyNonce`` instance
  (:ticket:`36810`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 6.0 where :func:`~django.urls.path` routes
  defined using :func:`~django.utils.translation.gettext_lazy` failed to
  resolve correctly (:ticket:`36796`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 6.0 where the :attr:`.Widget.use_fieldset`
  attribute of :class:`~django.forms.ClearableFileInput` was flipped
  from ``False`` to ``True`` (:ticket:`36829`).

* Reverted an undocumented optimization in Django 6.0 that modified permission
  :attr:`~django.contrib.auth.models.Permission.name` and
  :attr:`~django.contrib.auth.models.Permission.codename` values when renaming
  models via a migration. This change could affect unrelated
  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.models.Permission` objects (:ticket:`36843`) and
  did not report conflicts (:ticket:`36793`).
