Django 1.1.2 release notes
==========================

Welcome to Django 1.1.2!

This is the second "bugfix" release in the Django 1.1 series,
improving the stability and performance of the Django 1.1 codebase.

Django 1.1.2 maintains backwards compatibility with Django
1.1.0, but contain a number of fixes and other
improvements. Django 1.1.2 is a recommended upgrade for any
development or deployment currently using or targeting Django 1.1.

For full details on the new features, backwards incompatibilities, and
deprecated features in the 1.1 branch, see the :doc:`/releases/1.1`.

Backwards-incompatible changes in 1.1.2
=======================================

Test runner exit status code
----------------------------

The exit status code of the test runners (``tests/runtests.py`` and ``python
manage.py test``) no longer represents the number of failed tests, since a
failure of 256 or more tests resulted in a wrong exit status code. The exit
status code for the test runner is now 0 for success (no failing tests) and 1
for any number of test failures. If needed, the number of test failures can be
found at the end of the test runner's output.

Cookie encoding
---------------

To fix bugs with cookies in Internet Explorer, Safari, and possibly other
browsers, our encoding of cookie values was changed so that the characters
comma and semi-colon are treated as non-safe characters, and are therefore
encoded as ``\054`` and ``\073`` respectively. This could produce backwards
incompatibilities, especially if you are storing comma or semi-colon in
cookies and have JavaScript code that parses and manipulates cookie values
client-side.

One new feature
===============

Ordinarily, a point release would not include new features, but in the
case of Django 1.1.2, we have made an exception to this rule. Django
1.2 (the next major release of Django) will contain a feature that
will improve protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
attacks. This feature requires the use of a new :ttag:`csrf_token`
template tag in all forms that Django renders.

To make it easier to support both 1.1.X and 1.2.X versions of Django with the
same templates, we have decided to introduce the :ttag:`csrf_token` template
tag to the 1.1.X branch. In the 1.1.X branch, :ttag:`csrf_token` does nothing -
it has no effect on templates or form processing. However, it means that the
same template will work with Django 1.2.
