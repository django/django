0.8 (2015-09-10)
----------------

This release reworks a few of the core concepts to make the channel layer
more efficient and user friendly:

* Channel names now do not start with ``django``, and are instead just ``http.request``, etc.

* HTTP headers/GET/etc are only sent with ``websocket.connect`` rather than all websocket requests,
  to save a lot of bandwidth in the channel layer.

* The session/user decorators were renamed, and a ``@channel_session_user`` and ``transfer_user`` set of functions
  added to allow moving the user details from the HTTP session to the channel session in the ``connect`` consumer.

* A ``@linearize`` decorator was added to help ensure a ``connect``/``receive`` pair are not executed
  simultanously on two different workers.

* Channel backends gained locking mechanisms to support the ``linearize`` feature.

* ``runwsserver`` will use asyncio rather than Twisted if it's available.

* Message formats have been made a bit more consistent.
