Django 4.2.2 release notes
==========================

*Expected June 5, 2023*

Django 4.2.2 fixes several bugs in 4.2.1.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused an unnecessary
  ``DBMS_LOB.SUBSTR()`` wrapping in the ``__isnull`` and ``__exact=None``
  lookups for ``TextField()``/``BinaryField()`` on Oracle (:ticket:`34544`).

* Restored, following a regression in Django 4.2, ``get_prep_value()`` call in
  ``JSONField`` subclasses (:ticket:`34539`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of ``QuerySet.defer()``
  when passing a ``ManyToManyField`` or ``GenericForeignKey`` reference. While
  doing so is a no-op, it was allowed in older version (:ticket:`34570`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of ``QuerySet.only()``
  when passing a reverse ``OneToOneField`` reference (:ticket:`34612`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 4.2 where :option:`makemigrations --update` didn't
  respect the ``--name`` option (:ticket:`34568`).

* Fixed a performance regression in Django 4.2 when compiling queries without
  ordering (:ticket:`34580`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 where nonexistent stylesheet was linked on a
  “Congratulations!” page (:ticket:`34588`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of
  ``QuerySet.aggregate()`` with expressions referencing other aggregates
  (:ticket:`34551`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of
  ``QuerySet.aggregate()`` with aggregates referencing subqueries
  (:ticket:`34551`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of querysets on SQLite
  when filtering on ``DecimalField`` against values outside of the defined
  range (:ticket:`34590`).
