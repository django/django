Django 1.7 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
============================================

Welcome to Django 1.7!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, as well as some `backwards
incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from Django
1.6 or older versions. We've also dropped some features, which are detailed in
:doc:`our deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>`, and we've `begun the
deprecation process for some features`_.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in Django 1.7`_
.. _`backwards incompatible changes`: `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7`_
.. _`begun the deprecation process for some features`: `Features deprecated in 1.7`_

Python compatibility
====================

Django 1.7 requires Python 2.7 or above, though we **highly recommend**
the latest minor release. Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped.

This change should affect only a small number of Django users, as most
operating-system vendors today are shipping Python 2.7 or newer as their default
version. If you're still using Python 2.6, however, you'll need to stick to
Django 1.6 until you can upgrade your Python version. Per :doc:`our support
policy </internals/release-process>`, Django 1.6 will continue to receive
security support until the release of Django 1.8.

What's new in Django 1.7
========================

Calling custom ``QuerySet`` methods from the ``Manager``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`QuerySet.as_manager() <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.as_manager>`
class method has been added to :ref:`create Manager with QuerySet methods
<create-manager-with-queryset-methods>`.

Admin shortcuts support time zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "today" and "now" shortcuts next to date and time input widgets in the
admin are now operating in the :ref:`current time zone
<default-current-time-zone>`. Previously, they used the browser time zone,
which could result in saving the wrong value when it didn't match the current
time zone on the server.

In addition, the widgets now display a help message when the browser and
server time zone are different, to clarify how the value inserted in the field
will be interpreted.

Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The new :attr:`UploadedFile.content_type_extra
  <django.core.files.uploadedfile.UploadedFile.content_type_extra>` attribute
  contains extra parameters passed to the ``content-type`` header on a file
  upload.

* The ``enter`` argument was added to the
  :data:`~django.test.signals.setting_changed` signal.

* The :meth:`QuerySet.update_or_create()
  <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.update_or_create>` method was added.

* :attr:`~django.db.models.Options.app_label` is no longer required for models
  that are defined in a ``models`` package within an app.

* The :meth:`Context.push() <django.template.Context.push>` method now returns
  a context manager which automatically calls :meth:`pop()
  <django.template.Context.pop>` upon exiting the ``with`` statement.
  Additionally, :meth:`push() <django.template.Context.push>` now accepts
  parameters that are passed to the ``dict`` constructor used to build the new
  context level.

* The :class:`~django.utils.feedgenerator.Atom1Feed` syndication feed's
  ``updated`` element now utilizes `updateddate` instead of ``pubdate``,
  allowing the ``published`` element to be included in the feed (which
  relies on ``pubdate``).

* Buttons in :mod:`django.contrib.admin` now use the ``border-radius`` CSS
  property for rounded corners rather than GIF background images.

* Some admin templates now have ``app-<app_name>`` and ``model-<model_name>``
  classes in their ``<body>`` tag to allow customizing the CSS per app or per
  model.

* The admin changelist cells now have a ``field-<field_name>`` class in the
  HTML to enable style customizations.

* :func:`~django.core.mail.send_mail` now accepts an ``html_message``
  parameter for sending a multipart ``text/plain`` and ``text/html`` email.

* The :djadminopt:`--no-color` option for ``django-admin.py`` allows you to
  disable the colorization of management command output.

* The :mod:`sitemap framework<django.contrib.sitemaps>` now makes use of
  :attr:`~django.contrib.sitemaps.Sitemap.lastmod` to set a ``Last-Modified``
  header in the response. This makes it possible for the
  :class:`~django.middleware.http.ConditionalGetMiddleware` to handle
  conditional ``GET`` requests for sitemaps which set ``lastmod``.

* You can override the new :meth:`AuthenticationForm.confirm_login_allowed()
  <django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm.confirm_login_allowed>` method
  to more easily customize the login policy.

Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7
=====================================

.. warning::

    In addition to the changes outlined in this section, be sure to review the
    :doc:`deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>` for any features that
    have been removed. If you haven't updated your code within the
    deprecation timeline for a given feature, its removal may appear as a
    backwards incompatible change.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The :meth:`django.core.files.uploadhandler.FileUploadHandler.new_file()`
  method is now passed an additional ``content_type_extra`` parameter. If you
  have a custom :class:`~django.core.files.uploadhandler.FileUploadHandler`
  that implements ``new_file()``, be sure it accepts this new parameter.

* :class:`ModelFormSet<django.forms.models.BaseModelFormSet>`'s no longer
  delete instances when ``save(commit=False)`` is called. See
  :attr:`~django.forms.formsets.BaseFormSet.can_delete` for instructions on how
  to manually delete objects from deleted forms.

* Loading empty fixtures emits a ``RuntimeWarning`` rather than raising
  :class:`~django.core.management.CommandError`.

* :func:`django.contrib.staticfiles.views.serve` will now raise an
  :exc:`~django.http.Http404` exception instead of
  :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` when :setting:`DEBUG`
  is ``False``. This change removes the need to conditionally add the view to
  your root URLconf, which in turn makes it safe to reverse by name. It also
  removes the ability for visitors to generate spurious HTTP 500 errors by
  requesting static files that don't exist or haven't been collected yet.

Features deprecated in 1.7
==========================

``django.utils.dictconfig``/``django.utils.importlib``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.dictconfig`` and ``django.utils.importlib`` were copies of
respectively :mod:`logging.config` and :mod:`importlib` provided for Python
versions prior to 2.7. They have been deprecated.

``django.utils.unittest``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.unittest`` provided uniform access to the ``unittest2`` library
on all Python versions. Since ``unittest2`` became the standard library's
:mod:`unittest` module in Python 2.7, and Django 1.7 drops support for older
Python versions, this module isn't useful anymore. It has been deprecated. Use
:mod:`unittest` instead.

Custom SQL location for models package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, if models were organized in a package (``myapp/models/``) rather
than simply ``myapp/models.py``, Django would look for :ref:`initial SQL data
<initial-sql>` in ``myapp/models/sql/``. This bug has been fixed so that Django
will search ``myapp/sql/`` as documented. The old location will continue to
work until Django 1.9.
