Django 1.7 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
============================================

Welcome to Django 1.7!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, as well as some `backwards
incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from Django
1.6 or older versions. We've also dropped some features, which are detailed in
:doc:`our deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>`, and we've `begun the
deprecation process for some features`_.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in Django 1.7`_
.. _`backwards incompatible changes`: `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7`_
.. _`begun the deprecation process for some features`: `Features deprecated in 1.7`_

Python compatibility
====================

Django 1.7 requires Python 2.7 or above, though we **highly recommend**
the latest minor release. Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped.

This change should affect only a small number of Django users, as most
operating-system vendors today are shipping Python 2.7 or newer as their default
version. If you're still using Python 2.6, however, you'll need to stick to
Django 1.6 until you can upgrade your Python version. Per :doc:`our support
policy </internals/release-process>`, Django 1.6 will continue to receive
security support until the release of Django 1.8.

What's new in Django 1.7
========================

Admin shortcuts support time zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "today" and "now" shortcuts next to date and time input widgets in the
admin are now operating in the :ref:`current time zone
<default-current-time-zone>`. Previously, they used the browser time zone,
which could result in saving the wrong value when it didn't match the current
time zone on the server.

In addition, the widgets now display a help message when the browser and
server time zone are different, to clarify how the value inserted in the field
will be interpreted.

Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The new :attr:`UploadedFile.content_type_extra
  <django.core.files.uploadedfile.UploadedFile.content_type_extra>` attribute
  contains extra parameters passed to the ``content-type`` header on a file
  upload.

* The ``enter`` argument was added to the
  :data:`~django.test.signals.setting_changed` signal.

* The :meth:`QuerySet.update_or_create()
  <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.update_or_create>` method was added.

Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7
=====================================

.. warning::

    In addition to the changes outlined in this section, be sure to review the
    :doc:`deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>` for any features that
    have been removed. If you haven't updated your code within the
    deprecation timeline for a given feature, its removal may appear as a
    backwards incompatible change.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The :meth:`django.core.files.uploadhandler.FileUploadHandler.new_file()`
  method is now passed an additional ``content_type_extra`` parameter. If you
  have a custom :class:`~django.core.files.uploadhandler.FileUploadHandler`
  that implements ``new_file()``, be sure it accepts this new parameter.

Features deprecated in 1.7
==========================

``django.utils.dictconfig``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.dictconfig`` was a copy of :mod:`logging.config` provided for
Python versions prior to 2.7. It has been deprecated.

``django.utils.unittest``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.unittest`` provided uniform access to the ``unittest2`` library
on all Python versions. Since ``unittest2`` became the standard library's
:mod:`unittest` module in Python 2.7, and Django 1.7 drops support for older
Python versions, this module isn't useful anymore. It has been deprecated. Use
:mod:`unittest` instead.
