===========================

Django 5.0.11 fixes a security issue with severity "moderate" in 5.0.10.

CVE-2024-56374: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in IPv6 validation
============================================================================

Lack of upper bound limit enforcement in strings passed when performing IPv6
validation could lead to a potential denial-of-service attack. The undocumented
and private functions ``clean_ipv6_address`` and ``is_valid_ipv6_address`` were
vulnerable, as was the  :class:`django.forms.GenericIPAddressField` form field,
which has now been updated to define a ``max_length`` of 39 characters.

The :class:`django.db.models.GenericIPAddressField` model field was not
affected.
