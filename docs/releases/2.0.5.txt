Django 2.0.5 release notes
==========================

*May 1, 2018*

Django 2.0.5 fixes several bugs in 2.0.4.

Bugfixes
========

* Corrected the import paths that ``inspectdb`` generates for
  ``django.contrib.postgres`` fields (:ticket:`29307`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 1.11.8 where altering a field with a unique
  constraint may drop and rebuild more foreign keys than necessary
  (:ticket:`29193`).

* Fixed crashes in ``django.contrib.admindocs`` when a view is a callable
  object, such as ``django.contrib.syndication.views.Feed`` (:ticket:`29296`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 2.0.4 where ``QuerySet.values()`` or
  ``values_list()`` after combining an annotated and unannotated queryset with
  ``union()``, ``difference()``, or ``intersection()`` crashed due to
  mismatching columns (:ticket:`29286`).
