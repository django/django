Django 2.2.28 release notes
===========================

*April 11, 2022*

Django 2.2.28 fixes two security issues with severity "high" in 2.2.27.

CVE-2022-28346: Potential SQL injection in ``QuerySet.annotate()``, ``aggregate()``, and ``extra()``
====================================================================================================

:meth:`.QuerySet.annotate`, :meth:`~.QuerySet.aggregate`, and
:meth:`~.QuerySet.extra` methods were subject to SQL injection in column
aliases, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the
``**kwargs`` passed to these methods.
