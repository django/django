Django 4.0.4 release notes
==========================

*April 11, 2022*

Django 4.0.4 fixes two security issues with severity "high" and two bugs in
4.0.3.

CVE-2022-28346: Potential SQL injection in ``QuerySet.annotate()``, ``aggregate()``, and ``extra()``
====================================================================================================

:meth:`.QuerySet.annotate`, :meth:`~.QuerySet.aggregate`, and
:meth:`~.QuerySet.extra` methods were subject to SQL injection in column
aliases, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the
``**kwargs`` passed to these methods.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.0 that caused ignoring multiple
  ``FilteredRelation()`` relationships to the same field (:ticket:`33598`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2.4 that caused the auto-reloader to no longer
  detect changes when the ``DIRS`` option of the ``TEMPLATES`` setting
  contained an empty string (:ticket:`33628`).
