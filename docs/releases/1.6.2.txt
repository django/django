Django 1.6.2 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

This is Django 1.6.2, a bugfix release for Django 1.6.

Django's vendored version of six, :mod:`django.utils.six` has been upgraded to
the latest release (1.5.2).

Bug fixes
=========

* Prevented the base geometry object of a prepared geometry to be garbage
  collected, which could lead to crash Django (#21662).

* Fixed a crash when executing the :djadmin:`changepassword` command when the
  user object representation contained non-ASCII characters (#21627).

* The :djadmin:`collectstatic` command will raise an error rather than
  default to using the current working directory if :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` is
  not set. Combined with the ``--clear`` option, the previous behavior could
  wipe anything below the current working directory (#21581).

* Fixed mail encoding on Python 3.3.3+ (#21093).

* Fixed an issue where when
  ``settings.DATABASES['default']['AUTOCOMMIT'] = False``, the connection
  wasn't in autocommit mode but Django pretended it was.

* Fixed a regression in multiple-table inheritance ``exclude()`` queries
  (#21787).

* Added missing items to ``django.utils.timezone.__all__`` (#21880).

* Fixed an issue where lazy objects weren't actually marked as safe when passed
  through :func:`~django.utils.safestring.mark_safe` and could end up being
  double-escaped (#21882).
