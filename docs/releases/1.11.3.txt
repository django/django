Django 1.11.3 release notes
===========================

*Under development*

Django 1.11.3 fixes several bugs in 1.11.2.

Bugfixes
========

* Removed an incorrect deprecation warning about a missing ``renderer``
  argument if a ``Widget.render()`` method accepts ``**kwargs``
  (:ticket:`28265`).

* Fixed a regression causing ``Model.__init__()`` to crash if a field has an
  instance only descriptor (:ticket:`28269`).

* Fixed an incorrect ``DisallowedModelAdminLookup`` exception when using
  a nested reverse relation in ``list_filter`` (:ticket:`28262`).

* Fixed admin's ``FieldListFilter.get_queryset()`` crash on invalid input
  (:ticket:`28202`).

* Fixed invalid HTML for a required ``AdminFileWidget`` (:ticket:`28278`).

* Fixed model initialization to set the name of class-based model indexes
  for models that only inherit ``models.Model`` (:ticket:`28282`).

* Fixed crash in admin's inlines when a model has an inherited non-editable
  primary key (:ticket:`27967`).

* Fixed ``QuerySet.union()``, ``intersection()``, and ``difference()`` when
  combining with an ``EmptyQuerySet`` (:ticket:`28293`).

* Prevented ``Paginator``’s unordered object list warning from evaluating a
  ``QuerySet`` (:ticket:`28284`).

* Fixed the value of ``redirect_field_name`` in ``LoginView``’s template
  context. It's now an empty string (as it is for the original function-based
  ``login()`` view) if the corresponding parameter isn't sent in a request (in
  particular, when the login page is accessed directly) (:ticket:`28229`).
