Django 3.0.1 release notes
==========================

*Expected January 2, 2020*

Django 3.0.1 fixes several bugs in 3.0.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 by restoring the ability to use Django
  inside Jupyter and other environments that force an async context, by adding
  and option to disable :ref:`async-safety` mechanism with
  ``DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE`` environment variable (:ticket:`31056`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 where ``RegexPattern``, used by
  :func:`~django.urls.re_path`, returned positional arguments to be passed to
  the view when all optional named groups were missing (:ticket:`31061`).
