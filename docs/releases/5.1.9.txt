==========================
Django 5.1.9 release notes
==========================

*Expected May 7, 2025*

Django 5.1.9 fixes a data loss bug in 5.1.8.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a data corruption possibility in ``file_move_safe()`` when
  ``allow_overwrite=True``, where leftover content from a previously larger
  file could remain after overwriting with a smaller one due to lack of
  truncation (:ticket:`36298`).
