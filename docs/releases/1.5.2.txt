Django 1.5.2 release notes
==========================

*August 13, 2013*

This is Django 1.5.2, a bugfix and security release for Django 1.5.

Mitigated possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs
=============================================================

Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
``django.contrib.auth.views.login()``, ``django.contrib.comments``, and
:doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to an "on success" URL.
The security checks for these redirects (namely
``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) didn't check if the scheme is ``http(s)``
and as such allowed ``javascript:...`` URLs to be entered. If a developer
relied on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect targets and put such a
URL into a link, they could suffer from a XSS attack. This bug doesn't affect
Django currently, since we only put this URL into the ``Location`` response
header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript there.

XSS vulnerability in :mod:`django.contrib.admin`
================================================

If a :class:`~django.db.models.URLField` is used in Django 1.5, it displays the
current value of the field and a link to the target on the admin change page.
The display routine of this widget was flawed and allowed for XSS.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a crash with :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.prefetch_related`
  (#19607) as well as some ``pickle`` regressions with ``prefetch_related``
  (#20157 and #20257).
* Fixed a regression in :mod:`django.contrib.gis` in the Google Map output on
  Python 3 (#20773).
* Made ``DjangoTestSuiteRunner.setup_databases`` properly handle aliases for
  the default database (#19940) and prevented ``teardown_databases`` from
  attempting to tear down aliases (#20681).
* Fixed the ``django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache`` backend's
  ``get_many()`` method on Python 3 (#20722).
* Fixed :mod:`django.contrib.humanize` translation syntax errors. Affected
  languages: Mexican Spanish, Mongolian, Romanian, Turkish (#20695).
* Added support for wheel packages (#19252).
* The CSRF token now rotates when a user logs in.
* Some Python 3 compatibility fixes including #20212 and #20025.
* Fixed some rare cases where :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get`
  exceptions recursed infinitely (#20278).
* :djadmin:`makemessages` no longer crashes with ``UnicodeDecodeError``
  (#20354).
* Fixed ``geojson`` detection with SpatiaLite.
* :meth:`~django.test.SimpleTestCase.assertContains` once again works with
  binary content (#20237).
* Fixed :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` if it has a Unicode ``name``
  parameter (#20207).
* Ensured that the WSGI request's path is correctly based on the
  ``SCRIPT_NAME`` environment variable or the :setting:`FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`
  setting, regardless of whether or not either has a trailing slash (#20169).
* Fixed an obscure bug with the :func:`~django.test.override_settings`
  decorator. If you hit an ``AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute
  '_original_allowed_hosts'`` exception, it's probably fixed (#20636).
