Release notes
=============

Release notes for the official Django releases. Each release note will tell you
what's new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible
changes made in that version.

For those :doc:`upgrading to a new version of Django</howto/upgrade-version>`,
you will need to check all the backwards-incompatible changes and
:doc:`deprecated features</internals/deprecation>` for each 'final' release
from the one after your current Django version, up to and including the new
version.

Security releases
=================

Whenever a security issue is disclosed via :doc:`Django's security
policies </internals/security>`, appropriate release notes are now
added to all affected release series.

Additionally, :doc:`an archive of disclosed security issues
</releases/security>` is maintained.

Development releases
====================

These notes are retained for historical purposes. If you are upgrading
between formal Django releases, you don't need to worry about these
notes.
