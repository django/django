.TH "DJANGO-ADMIN" "1" "January 15, 2025" "5.2" "Django"
.SH NAME
django-admin \- Utility script for the Django web framework
.sp
\fBdjango\-admin\fP is Django\(aqs command\-line utility for administrative tasks.
This document outlines all it can do.
.sp
In addition, \fBmanage.py\fP is automatically created in each Django project. It
does the same thing as \fBdjango\-admin\fP but also sets the
\fI\%DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\fP environment variable so that it points to your
project\(aqs \fBsettings.py\fP file.
.sp
The \fBdjango\-admin\fP script should be on your system path if you installed
Django via \fBpip\fP\&. If it\(aqs not in your path, ensure you have your virtual
environment activated.
.sp
Generally, when working on a single Django project, it\(aqs easier to use
\fBmanage.py\fP than \fBdjango\-admin\fP\&. If you need to switch between multiple
Django settings files, use \fBdjango\-admin\fP with
\fI\%DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\fP or the \fI\%\-\-settings\fP command line
option.
.sp
The command\-line examples throughout this document use \fBdjango\-admin\fP to
be consistent, but any example can use \fBmanage.py\fP or \fBpython \-m django\fP
just as well.
.SH USAGE

.sp
\fBcommand\fP should be one of the commands listed in this document.
\fBoptions\fP, which is optional, should be zero or more of the options available
for the given command.
.SS Getting runtime help
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin help
.UNINDENT
.sp
Run \fBdjango\-admin help\fP to display usage information and a list of the
commands provided by each application.
.sp
Run \fBdjango\-admin help \-\-commands\fP to display a list of all available
commands.
.sp
Run \fBdjango\-admin help <command>\fP to display a description of the given
command and a list of its available options.
.SS App names
.sp
Many commands take a list of \(dqapp names.\(dq An \(dqapp name\(dq is the basename of
the package containing your models. For example, if your \fI\%INSTALLED_APPS\fP
contains the string \fB\(aqmysite.blog\(aq\fP, the app name is \fBblog\fP\&.
.SS Determining the version
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin version

.SH AVAILABLE COMMANDS
.SS \fBcheck\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin check [app_label [app_label ...]]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Uses the \fI\%system check framework\fP to inspect the entire
Django project for common problems.
.sp
By default, all apps will be checked. You can check a subset of apps by
providing a list of app labels as arguments:
.INDENT 0.0

.EX
django\-admin check auth admin myapp
.EE
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-\-tag TAGS, \-t TAGS
.UNINDENT
.sp
The system check framework performs many different types of checks that are
\fI\%categorized with tags\fP\&. You can use these
tags to restrict the checks performed to just those in a particular category.
For example, to perform only models and compatibility checks, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin check \-\-tag models \-\-tag compatibility
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-\-database DATABASE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database to run checks requiring database access:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin check \-\-database default \-\-database other
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, these checks will not be run.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-list\-tags
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lists all available tags.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-deploy
.UNINDENT
.sp
Activates some additional checks that are only relevant in a deployment setting.
.sp
You can use this option in your local development environment, but since your
local development settings module may not have many of your production settings,
you will probably want to point the \fBcheck\fP command at a different settings
module, either by setting the \fI\%DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\fP environment
variable, or by passing the \fB\-\-settings\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin check \-\-deploy \-\-settings=production_settings
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or you could run it directly on a production or staging deployment to verify
that the correct settings are in use (omitting \fB\-\-settings\fP). You could even
make it part of your integration test suite.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fail\-level {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBdiffsettings\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin diffsettings
.UNINDENT
.sp
Displays differences between the current settings file and Django\(aqs default
settings (or another settings file specified by \fI\%\-\-default\fP).
.sp
Settings that don\(aqt appear in the defaults are followed by \fB\(dq###\(dq\fP\&. For
example, the default settings don\(aqt define \fI\%ROOT_URLCONF\fP, so
\fI\%ROOT_URLCONF\fP is followed by \fB\(dq###\(dq\fP in the output of
\fBdiffsettings\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-all
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-default MODULE
.UNINDENT
.sp
The settings module to compare the current settings against. Leave empty to
compare against Django\(aqs default settings.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-output {hash,unified}
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the output format. Available values are \fBhash\fP and \fBunified\fP\&.
\fBhash\fP is the default mode that displays the output that\(aqs described above.
\fBunified\fP displays the output similar to \fBdiff \-u\fP\&. Default settings are
prefixed with a minus sign, followed by the changed setting prefixed with a
plus sign.
.SS \fBdumpdata\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin dumpdata [app_label[.ModelName] [app_label[.ModelName] ...]]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Outputs to standard output all data in the database associated with the named
application(s).
.sp
If no application name is provided, all installed applications will be dumped.
.sp
The output of \fBdumpdata\fP can be used as input for \fI\%loaddata\fP\&.
.sp
When result of \fBdumpdata\fP is saved as a file, it can serve as a
\fI\%fixture\fP for
\fI\%tests\fP or as an
\fI\%initial data\fP\&.
.sp
Note that \fBdumpdata\fP uses the default manager on the model for selecting the
records to dump. If you\(aqre using a \fI\%custom manager\fP as
the default manager and it filters some of the available records, not all of the
objects will be dumped.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-all, \-a
.UNINDENT
.sp
Uses Django\(aqs base manager, dumping records which might otherwise be filtered
or modified by a custom manager.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-format FORMAT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the serialization format of the output. Defaults to JSON. Supported
formats are listed in \fI\%Serialization formats\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-indent INDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the number of indentation spaces to use in the output. Defaults to
\fBNone\fP which displays all data on single line.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-exclude EXCLUDE, \-e EXCLUDE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Prevents specific applications or models (specified in the form of
\fBapp_label.ModelName\fP) from being dumped. If you specify a model name, then
only that model will be excluded, rather than the entire application. You can
also mix application names and model names.
.sp
If you want to exclude multiple applications, pass \fB\-\-exclude\fP more than
once:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin dumpdata \-\-exclude=auth \-\-exclude=contenttypes
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database from which data will be dumped. Defaults to \fBdefault\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-natural\-foreign
.UNINDENT
.sp
Uses the \fBnatural_key()\fP model method to serialize any foreign key and
many\-to\-many relationship to objects of the type that defines the method. If
you\(aqre dumping \fBcontrib.auth\fP \fBPermission\fP objects or
\fBcontrib.contenttypes\fP \fBContentType\fP objects, you should probably use this
flag. See the \fI\%natural keys\fP
documentation for more details on this and the next option.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-natural\-primary
.UNINDENT
.sp
Omits the primary key in the serialized data of this object since it can be
calculated during deserialization.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pks PRIMARY_KEYS
.UNINDENT
.sp
Outputs only the objects specified by a comma separated list of primary keys.
This is only available when dumping one model. By default, all the records of
the model are output.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-output OUTPUT, \-o OUTPUT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies a file to write the serialized data to. By default, the data goes to
standard output.
.sp
When this option is set and \fB\-\-verbosity\fP is greater than 0 (the default), a
progress bar is shown in the terminal.
.SS Fixtures compression
.sp
The output file can be compressed with one of the \fBbz2\fP, \fBgz\fP, \fBlzma\fP, or
\fBxz\fP formats by ending the filename with the corresponding extension.
For example, to output the data as a compressed JSON file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin dumpdata \-o mydata.json.gz
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBflush\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin flush
.UNINDENT
.sp
Removes all data from the database and re\-executes any post\-synchronization
handlers. The table of which migrations have been applied is not cleared.
.sp
If you would rather start from an empty database and rerun all migrations, you
should drop and recreate the database and then run \fI\%migrate\fP instead.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-noinput, \-\-no\-input
.UNINDENT
.sp
Suppresses all user prompts.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-database DATABASE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database to flush. Defaults to \fBdefault\fP\&.
.SS \fBinspectdb\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin inspectdb [table [table ...]]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Introspects the database tables in the database pointed\-to by the
\fI\%NAME\fP setting and outputs a Django model module (a \fBmodels.py\fP
file) to standard output.
.sp
You may choose what tables or views to inspect by passing their names as
arguments. If no arguments are provided, models are created for views only if
the \fI\%\-\-include\-views\fP option is used. Models for partition tables are
created on PostgreSQL if the \fI\%\-\-include\-partitions\fP option is used.
.sp
Use this if you have a legacy database with which you\(aqd like to use Django.
The script will inspect the database and create a model for each table within
it.
.sp
As you might expect, the created models will have an attribute for every field
in the table. Note that \fBinspectdb\fP has a few special cases in its field\-name
output:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBinspectdb\fP cannot map a column\(aqs type to a model field type, it\(aqll
use \fBTextField\fP and will insert the Python comment
\fB\(aqThis field type is a guess.\(aq\fP next to the field in the generated
model. The recognized fields may depend on apps listed in
\fI\%INSTALLED_APPS\fP\&. For example, \fI\%django.contrib.postgres\fP adds
recognition for several PostgreSQL\-specific field types.
.IP \(bu 2
If the database column name is a Python reserved word (such as
\fB\(aqpass\(aq\fP, \fB\(aqclass\(aq\fP or \fB\(aqfor\(aq\fP), \fBinspectdb\fP will append
\fB\(aq_field\(aq\fP to the attribute name. For example, if a table has a column
\fB\(aqfor\(aq\fP, the generated model will have a field \fB\(aqfor_field\(aq\fP, with
the \fBdb_column\fP attribute set to \fB\(aqfor\(aq\fP\&. \fBinspectdb\fP will insert
the Python comment
\fB\(aqField renamed because it was a Python reserved word.\(aq\fP next to the
field.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This feature is meant as a shortcut, not as definitive model generation. After
you run it, you\(aqll want to look over the generated models yourself to make
customizations. In particular, you\(aqll need to rearrange models\(aq order, so that
models that refer to other models are ordered properly.
.sp
Django doesn\(aqt create database defaults when a
\fI\%default\fP is specified on a model field.
Similarly, database defaults aren\(aqt translated to model field defaults or
detected in any fashion by \fBinspectdb\fP\&.
.sp
By default, \fBinspectdb\fP creates unmanaged models. That is, \fBmanaged = False\fP
in the model\(aqs \fBMeta\fP class tells Django not to manage each table\(aqs creation,
modification, and deletion. If you do want to allow Django to manage the
table\(aqs lifecycle, you\(aqll need to change the
\fI\%managed\fP option to \fBTrue\fP (or remove
it because \fBTrue\fP is its default value).

No arguments: All apps have all of their migrations run.

\fB<app_label>\fP: The specified app has its migrations run, up to the most
recent migration. This may involve running other apps\(aq migrations too, due
to dependencies.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<app_label> <migrationname>\fP: Brings the database schema to a state where
the named migration is applied, but no later migrations in the same app are
applied. This may involve unapplying migrations if you have previously
migrated past the named migration. You can use a prefix of the migration
name, e.g. \fB0001\fP, as long as it\(aqs unique for the given app name. Use the

.sp
If you run this script as a user with normal privileges (recommended), you

.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request, as
needed. You don\(aqt need to restart the server for code changes to take effect.
However, some actions like adding files don\(aqt trigger a restart, so you\(aqll
have to restart the server in these cases.
.sp
If you\(aqre using Linux or MacOS and install both \X'tty: link https://pypi.org/project/pywatchman/'\fI\%pywatchman\fP\X'tty: link' and the
\X'tty: link https://facebook.github.io/watchman/'\fI\%Watchman\fP\X'tty: link' service, kernel signals will be used to autoreload the server
(rather than polling file modification timestamps each second). This offers
better performance on large projects, reduced response time after code changes,
more robust change detection, and a reduction in power usage. Django supports
\fBpywatchman\fP 1.2.0 and higher.

When you start the server, and each time you change Python code while the
server is running, the system check framework will check your entire Django
project for some common errors (see the \fI\%check\fP command). If any
errors are found, they will be printed to standard output. You can use the
\fB\-\-skip\-checks\fP option to skip running system checks.
.sp
You can run as many concurrent servers as you want, as long as they\(aqre on
separate ports by executing \fBdjango\-admin runserver\fP more than once.
.sp
Note that the default IP address, \fB127.0.0.1\fP, is not accessible from other
machines on your network. To make your development server viewable to other
machines on the network, use its own IP address (e.g. \fB192.168.2.1\fP), \fB0\fP
(shortcut for \fB0.0.0.0\fP), \fB0.0.0.0\fP, or \fB::\fP (with IPv6 enabled).
.sp
You can provide an IPv6 address surrounded by brackets
(e.g. \fB[200a::1]:8000\fP). This will automatically enable IPv6 support.
.sp
A hostname containing ASCII\-only characters can also be used.
.sp
If the \fI\%staticfiles\fP contrib app is enabled

When the app template files are rendered with the Django template
engine (by default all \fB*.py\fP files), Django will also replace all
stray template variables contained. For example, if one of the Python files
contains a docstring explaining a particular feature related
to template rendering, it might result in an incorrect example.

To work around this problem, you can use the \fI\%templatetag\fP
template tag to \(dqescape\(dq the various parts of the template syntax.

In addition, to allow Python template files that contain Django template
language syntax while also preventing packaging systems from trying to

.INDENT 3.5
The contents of custom app (or project) templates should always be
audited before use: Such templates define code that will become
part of your project, and this means that such code will be trusted
as much as any app you install, or code you write yourself.
Further, even rendering the templates is, effectively, executing
code that was provided as input to the management command. The
Django template language may provide wide access into the system,
so make sure any custom template you use is worthy of your trust.

Randomizes the order of tests before running them. This can help detect tests

seed is chosen randomly and printed to the console. To repeat a particular test
order, pass a seed. The test orders generated by this option preserve Django\(aqs
\fI\%guarantees on test order\fP\&. They also keep tests grouped
by test case class.
.sp
The shuffled orderings also have a special consistency property useful when
narrowing down isolation issues. Namely, for a given seed and when running a
subset of tests, the new order will be the original shuffling restricted to the
smaller set. Similarly, when adding tests while keeping the seed the same, the
order of the original tests will be the same in the new order.

Runs tests in separate parallel processes. Since modern processors have

Using \fB\-\-parallel\fP without a value, or with the value \fBauto\fP, runs one test
process per core according to \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.cpu_count'\fI\%multiprocessing.cpu_count()\fP\X'tty: link'\&. You can
override this by passing the desired number of processes, e.g.

Django distributes test cases — \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase'\fI\%unittest.TestCase\fP\X'tty: link' subclasses — to
subprocesses. If there are fewer test case classes than configured processes,
Django will reduce the number of processes accordingly.

Each process gets its own database. You must ensure that different test case
classes don\(aqt access the same resources. For instance, test case classes that

This command is only available if the \fI\%static files application\fP (\fBdjango.contrib.staticfiles\fP) is installed.
.sp
Please refer to its \fI\%description\fP in the
\fI\%staticfiles\fP documentation.
.SS \fBfindstatic\fP
.sp
This command is only available if the \fI\%static files application\fP (\fBdjango.contrib.staticfiles\fP) is installed.
.sp
Please refer to its \fI\%description\fP in the \fI\%staticfiles\fP documentation.
.SH DEFAULT OPTIONS
.sp
Although some commands may allow their own custom options, every command
allows for the following options by default:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pythonpath PYTHONPATH
.UNINDENT
.sp
Adds the given filesystem path to the Python \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path'\fI\%sys.path\fP\X'tty: link' module
attribute. If this isn\(aqt provided, \fBdjango\-admin\fP will use the
\X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH'\fI\%PYTHONPATH\fP\X'tty: link' environment variable.
.sp
This option is unnecessary in \fBmanage.py\fP, because it takes care of setting
the Python path for you.
.sp
Example usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin migrate \-\-pythonpath=\(aq/home/djangoprojects/myproject\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-settings SETTINGS
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the settings module to use. The settings module should be in Python
package syntax, e.g. \fBmysite.settings\fP\&. If this isn\(aqt provided,
\fBdjango\-admin\fP will use the \fI\%DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\fP environment
variable.
.sp
This option is unnecessary in \fBmanage.py\fP, because it uses
\fBsettings.py\fP from the current project by default.
.sp
Example usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin migrate \-\-settings=mysite.settings
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-traceback
.UNINDENT
.sp
Displays a full stack trace when a \fI\%CommandError\fP
is raised. By default, \fBdjango\-admin\fP will show an error message when a
\fBCommandError\fP occurs and a full stack trace for any other exception.
.sp
This option is ignored by \fI\%runserver\fP\&.
.sp
Example usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin migrate \-\-traceback
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-verbosity {0,1,2,3}, \-v {0,1,2,3}
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the amount of notification and debug information that a command
should print to the console.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB0\fP means no output.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB1\fP means normal output (default).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB2\fP means verbose output.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB3\fP means \fIvery\fP verbose output.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This option is ignored by \fI\%runserver\fP\&.
.sp
Example usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin migrate \-\-verbosity 2
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-color
.UNINDENT
.sp
Disables colorized command output.  Some commands format their output to be
colorized. For example, errors will be printed to the console in red and SQL
statements will be syntax highlighted.
.sp
Example usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin runserver \-\-no\-color
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-force\-color
.UNINDENT
.sp
Forces colorization of the command output if it would otherwise be disabled
as discussed in \fI\%Syntax coloring\fP\&. For example, you may want to pipe
colored output to another command.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-skip\-checks
.UNINDENT
.sp
Skips running system checks prior to running the command. This option is only
available if the
\fI\%requires_system_checks\fP command
attribute is not an empty list or tuple.
.sp
Example usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin migrate \-\-skip\-checks
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH EXTRA NICETIES
.SS Syntax coloring
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B DJANGO_COLORS
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBdjango\-admin\fP / \fBmanage.py\fP commands will use pretty
color\-coded output if your terminal supports ANSI\-colored output. It
won\(aqt use the color codes if you\(aqre piping the command\(aqs output to
another program unless the \fI\%\-\-force\-color\fP option is used.
.SS Windows support
.sp
On Windows 10, the \X'tty: link https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701'\fI\%Windows Terminal\fP\X'tty: link' application, \X'tty: link https://code.visualstudio.com'\fI\%VS Code\fP\X'tty: link', and PowerShell
(where virtual terminal processing is enabled) allow colored output, and are
supported by default.
.sp
Under Windows, the legacy \fBcmd.exe\fP native console doesn\(aqt support ANSI
escape sequences so by default there is no color output. In this case either of
two third\-party libraries are needed:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Install \X'tty: link https://pypi.org/project/colorama/'\fI\%colorama\fP\X'tty: link', a Python package that translates ANSI color codes
into Windows API calls. Django commands will detect its presence and will
make use of its services to color output just like on Unix\-based platforms.
\fBcolorama\fP can be installed via pip:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&...\e> py \-m pip install \(dqcolorama >= 0.4.6\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Install \X'tty: link http://adoxa.altervista.org/ansicon/'\fI\%ANSICON\fP\X'tty: link', a third\-party tool that allows \fBcmd.exe\fP to process
ANSI color codes. Django commands will detect its presence and will make use
of its services to color output just like on Unix\-based platforms.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other modern terminal environments on Windows, that support terminal colors,
but which are not automatically detected as supported by Django, may \(dqfake\(dq the
installation of \fBANSICON\fP by setting the appropriate environmental variable,
\fBANSICON=\(dqon\(dq\fP\&.
.SS Custom colors
.sp
The colors used for syntax highlighting can be customized. Django
ships with three color palettes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdark\fP, suited to terminals that show white text on a black
background. This is the default palette.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlight\fP, suited to terminals that show black text on a white
background.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnocolor\fP, which disables syntax highlighting.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You select a palette by setting a \fI\%DJANGO_COLORS\fP environment
variable to specify the palette you want to use. For example, to
specify the \fBlight\fP palette under a Unix or OS/X BASH shell, you
would run the following at a command prompt:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
export DJANGO_COLORS=\(dqlight\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also customize the colors that are used. Django specifies a
number of roles in which color is used:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBerror\fP \- A major error.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnotice\fP \- A minor error.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsuccess\fP \- A success.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwarning\fP \- A warning.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsql_field\fP \- The name of a model field in SQL.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsql_coltype\fP \- The type of a model field in SQL.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsql_keyword\fP \- An SQL keyword.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsql_table\fP \- The name of a model in SQL.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhttp_info\fP \- A 1XX HTTP Informational server response.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhttp_success\fP \- A 2XX HTTP Success server response.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhttp_not_modified\fP \- A 304 HTTP Not Modified server response.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhttp_redirect\fP \- A 3XX HTTP Redirect server response other than 304.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhttp_not_found\fP \- A 404 HTTP Not Found server response.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhttp_bad_request\fP \- A 4XX HTTP Bad Request server response other than 404.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhttp_server_error\fP \- A 5XX HTTP Server Error response.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmigrate_heading\fP \- A heading in a migrations management command.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmigrate_label\fP \- A migration name.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each of these roles can be assigned a specific foreground and
background color, from the following list:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBblack\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBred\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgreen\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fByellow\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBblue\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmagenta\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcyan\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwhite\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each of these colors can then be modified by using the following
display options:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbold\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBunderscore\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBblink\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBreverse\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBconceal\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
A color specification follows one of the following patterns:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrole=fg\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrole=fg/bg\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrole=fg,option,option\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrole=fg/bg,option,option\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBrole\fP is the name of a valid color role, \fBfg\fP is the
foreground color, \fBbg\fP is the background color and each \fBoption\fP
is one of the color modifying options. Multiple color specifications
are then separated by a semicolon. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
export DJANGO_COLORS=\(dqerror=yellow/blue,blink;notice=magenta\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would specify that errors be displayed using blinking yellow on blue,
and notices displayed using magenta. All other color roles would be
left uncolored.
.sp
Colors can also be specified by extending a base palette. If you put
a palette name in a color specification, all the colors implied by that
palette will be loaded. So:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
export DJANGO_COLORS=\(dqlight;error=yellow/blue,blink;notice=magenta\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would specify the use of all the colors in the light color palette,
\fIexcept\fP for the colors for errors and notices which would be
overridden as specified.
.SS Bash completion
.sp
If you use the Bash shell, consider installing the Django bash completion
script, which lives in \X'tty: link https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/extras/django_bash_completion'\fI\%extras/django_bash_completion\fP\X'tty: link' in the Django source
distribution. It enables tab\-completion of \fBdjango\-admin\fP and
\fBmanage.py\fP commands, so you can, for instance...
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Type \fBdjango\-admin\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Press [TAB] to see all available options.
.IP \(bu 2
Type \fBsql\fP, then [TAB], to see all available options whose names start
with \fBsql\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
See \fI\%How to create custom django\-admin commands\fP for how to add customized actions.
.SS Black formatting
.sp
The Python files created by \fI\%startproject\fP, \fI\%startapp\fP,
\fI\%optimizemigration\fP, \fI\%makemigrations\fP, and
\fI\%squashmigrations\fP are formatted using the \fBblack\fP command if it is
present on your \fBPATH\fP\&.
.sp
If you have \fBblack\fP globally installed, but do not wish it used for the
current project, you can set the \fBPATH\fP explicitly:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
PATH=path/to/venv/bin django\-admin makemigrations
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For commands using \fBstdout\fP you can pipe the output to \fBblack\fP if needed:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
django\-admin inspectdb | black \-
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django.core.management.call_command(name, *args, **options)
.UNINDENT
.sp
To call a management command from code use \fBcall_command()\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
the name of the command to call or a command object. Passing the name is
preferred unless the object is required for testing.
.TP
.B \fB*args\fP
a list of arguments accepted by the command. Arguments are passed to the
argument parser, so you can use the same style as you would on the command
line. For example, \fBcall_command(\(aqflush\(aq, \(aq\-\-verbosity=0\(aq)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB**options\fP
named options accepted on the command\-line. Options are passed to the command
without triggering the argument parser, which means you\(aqll need to pass the
correct type. For example, \fBcall_command(\(aqflush\(aq, verbosity=0)\fP (zero must
be an integer rather than a string).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
from django.core import management
from django.core.management.commands import loaddata

management.call_command(\(dqflush\(dq, verbosity=0, interactive=False)
management.call_command(\(dqloaddata\(dq, \(dqtest_data\(dq, verbosity=0)
management.call_command(loaddata.Command(), \(dqtest_data\(dq, verbosity=0)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that command options that take no arguments are passed as keywords
with \fBTrue\fP or \fBFalse\fP, as you can see with the \fBinteractive\fP option above.
.sp
Named arguments can be passed by using either one of the following syntaxes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Similar to the command line
management.call_command(\(dqdumpdata\(dq, \(dq\-\-natural\-foreign\(dq)

# Named argument similar to the command line minus the initial dashes and
# with internal dashes replaced by underscores
management.call_command(\(dqdumpdata\(dq, natural_foreign=True)

# \(gause_natural_foreign_keys\(ga is the option destination variable
management.call_command(\(dqdumpdata\(dq, use_natural_foreign_keys=True)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some command options have different names when using \fBcall_command()\fP instead
of \fBdjango\-admin\fP or \fBmanage.py\fP\&. For example, \fBdjango\-admin
createsuperuser \-\-no\-input\fP translates to \fBcall_command(\(aqcreatesuperuser\(aq,
interactive=False)\fP\&. To find what keyword argument name to use for
\fBcall_command()\fP, check the command\(aqs source code for the \fBdest\fP argument
passed to \fBparser.add_argument()\fP\&.
.sp
Command options which take multiple options are passed a list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
management.call_command(\(dqdumpdata\(dq, exclude=[\(dqcontenttypes\(dq, \(dqauth\(dq])
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The return value of the \fBcall_command()\fP function is the same as the return
value of the \fBhandle()\fP method of the command.
.SH OUTPUT REDIRECTION
.sp
Note that you can redirect standard output and error streams as all commands
support the \fBstdout\fP and \fBstderr\fP options. For example, you could write:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
with open(\(dq/path/to/command_output\(dq, \(dqw\(dq) as f:
    management.call_command(\(dqdumpdata\(dq, stdout=f)
