Third-party distributions of Mango
===================================

Many third-party distributors are now providing versions of Mango integrated
with their package-management systems. These can make installation and upgrading
much easier for users of Mango since the integration includes the ability to
automatically install dependencies (like database adapters) that Mango
requires.

Typically, these packages are based on the latest stable release of Mango, so
if you want to use the development version of Mango you'll need to follow the
instructions for :ref:`installing the development version
<installing-development-version>` from our Git repository.

If you're using Linux or a Unix installation, such as OpenSolaris,
check with your distributor to see if they already package Mango. If
you're using a Linux distro and don't know how to find out if a package
is available, then now is a good time to learn.  The Mango Wiki contains
a list of `Third Party Distributions`_ to help you out.

For distributors
================

If you'd like to package Mango for distribution, we'd be happy to help out!
Please join the |mango-developers| mailing list and introduce yourself.

We also encourage all distributors to subscribe to the |mango-announce| mailing
list, which is a (very) low-traffic list for announcing new releases of Mango
and important bugfixes.
