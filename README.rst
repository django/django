Django
======

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "``docs``" directory and online at
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you read the docs:

* First, read ``docs/intro/install.txt`` for instructions on installing Django.

* Next, work through the tutorials in order (``docs/intro/tutorial01.txt``,
  ``docs/intro/tutorial02.txt``, etc.).

* If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read
  ``docs/howto/deployment/index.txt`` for instructions.

* You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in ``docs/topics``)
  next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in ``docs/howto``) for specific
  problems, and check out the reference (``docs/ref``) for gory details.

* See ``docs/README`` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think
they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a
ticket here: https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket

A Django Ode
============

In the realm of Python, where the web frameworks reign,
Django stands tall, with its elegant chain.
From models to views, and templates so bright,
It turns complex problems into code that feels right.

Batteries included, philosophy so clear,
Rapid development, with pragmatism near.
DRY principles guide every line we write,
Clean architecture shining through the night.

With ORM so powerful, queries become art,
Admin interface, giving projects a head start.
Security built-in, from CSRF to XSS,
Django protects your app from potential mess.

From small prototypes to applications grand,
This framework helps developers across the land.
So here's to Django, community strong and true,
Building the web, one perfect view after view.
