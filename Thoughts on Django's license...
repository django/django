OK, I've always been a creative commons guy... 
but now that I'm  working on my own services and products I actually see how generous Djangos licensing policy is.

Let me explain.
NEXTUS is obviously open source and largely based on open source materials; my new project on the other hand, is entirely closed source.

Here's why (obviously with out divulging any details about what the project is! That's a secret :D):

  1. Open sourcing my new project wouldn't really bring anything fresh or helpful to the Open Source world:
     With regards to the code, obviously its not like its all readily available, I have developed some pretty useful proprietary algorithms,
     but, its not like they would revolutionise the world of programming and the project is largely unrevolutionary.

  2. Open sourcing the code for my project would allow competitors steal some of our functions more easily, which is bad, because fundamenally
     this is a business.

  3. Open sourcing, actually poses more of a security threat than a security help. On larger projects (like Django) many people are auditing
     code all the time, left and right, if I were to open-source the code for this new project, for which I AM the backend, there's no one else,
     I feel as though at least at the beginning it is more likely for black hats to be auditing my code than helpful people, maybe I'm paranoid though...
 
  4. With regards to the other end of this op, my frontend guy, he's not comfortable with this, to bring a business to fruition, you can't just give away the product,
     we are working hard on this, coding, graphic design, businesss planning, it all takes up time and energy, and as we're both students,
     those are particularly valuable to us right now, during our examinations, so we don't just want to give this away, we feel protective over it.
  
  This brings my to my fifth and final point, this is all to do with my situation right now, once my project gains momentum, then I can re-evaluate the benefits of open source!
